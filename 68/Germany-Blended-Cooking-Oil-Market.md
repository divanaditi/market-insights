Sunflower oil holds a significant share due to its mild flavor, high smoke point, and health benefits, making it a preferred choice for everyday cooking. Palm oil is also widely used due to its cost-effectiveness and versatility in high-heat cooking applications. Canola oil, known for its neutral taste and low saturated fat content, has seen steady demand in health-conscious segments of the market. Soybean oil, with its abundant availability, is also commonly blended for both industrial and home-use cooking oils, appealing to consumers looking for an economical option with good frying capabilities.<p>In addition to the mainstream oils, the market also caters to specific consumer preferences, including blended oils that offer enhanced nutritional benefits. These blends may contain a combination of vegetable oils fortified with omega-3 fatty acids or high in monounsaturated fats, targeting health-conscious consumers. The increasing awareness of the importance of a balanced diet and healthier cooking alternatives has spurred demand for such value-added oil products. As consumer habits evolve, innovative blends that combine the benefits of different oils are gaining popularity. These oils often come with claims of heart-healthy properties, and their appeal is further bolstered by the growing trend of clean label products in the food sector.
