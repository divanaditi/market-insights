These products are designed to handle larger volumes of urine and are available in different sizes to ensure a secure fit for both men and women. Additionally, bladder control products include incontinence pants, which are popular for their discreet design and comfort, offering an alternative for those who require reliable protection and a more natural feeling throughout the day.</p><p>Another significant product type is catheters, often used for individuals with more severe urinary incontinence who cannot rely on absorbent products alone.
