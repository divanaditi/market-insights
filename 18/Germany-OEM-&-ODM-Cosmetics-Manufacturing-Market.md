Haircare products, including shampoos, conditioners, and styling gels, also show significant growth driven by increasing awareness of hair health and personalized care. As consumers seek sustainable and effective formulations, there is a rising preference for organic and natural ingredients, further shaping the market dynamics. Additionally, the makeup segment, which includes foundations, lipsticks, mascaras, and eyeshadows, continues to expand with evolving beauty trends, while fragrances remain a key category, driven by brand loyalty and seasonal preferences in the German market.</p><p>The increasing focus on personalization and product differentiation is also reshaping the cosmetics manufacturing sector. The rise of custom formulations, especially in skincare and makeup, has led to greater demand for manufacturers capable of providing tailored solutions.
