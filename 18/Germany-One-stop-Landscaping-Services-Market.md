Residential landscaping services focus on enhancing the aesthetic appeal and functionality of private homes and gardens. These services include lawn care, garden design, tree planting, and maintenance. The growing demand for personalized outdoor spaces in residential areas has fueled this segment, as homeowners increasingly seek professional help for creating attractive, low-maintenance landscapes. The rise of urban gardening trends and eco-friendly landscaping solutions also contributes to the growth of residential landscaping services in Germany.</p><p>On the other hand, commercial landscaping services cater to businesses, government buildings, and large public spaces, requiring more complex and large-scale landscaping projects. These services include landscape design, installation, and maintenance of gardens, lawns, and green spaces for office parks, hotels, shopping centers, and municipal areas. As commercial entities focus on enhancing their outdoor environments to attract customers and improve brand image, the demand for professional landscaping services in the commercial sector is rising.
