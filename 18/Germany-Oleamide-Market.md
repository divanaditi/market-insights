Industrial grade oleamide is primarily used in the manufacturing of plastic products, rubber, and other materials as a lubricant, dispersing agent, or anti-blocking agent. This type of oleamide has found widespread use in industries like automotive, construction, and manufacturing, where it enhances processing efficiency and reduces friction. Its versatility in various applications, such as in the production of plastic films, coatings, and inks, has driven its demand in the country. Additionally, industrial grade oleamide is also crucial in producing detergents, cosmetics, and personal care items, making it indispensable across a range of sectors in the German economy.<p>On the other hand, technical grade oleamide is utilized in applications that require a higher level of purity and specific performance characteristics. This type of oleamide is commonly found in the production of high-end lubricants, paints, and coatings, where it functions as a slip agent, anti-friction agent, and dispersing agent. Technical grade oleamide is also essential in the production of specialty chemicals, adhesives, and surface coatings, which require the highest standards of performance. With growing demand for advanced industrial applications, the technical grade oleamide segment is anticipated to see increased adoption in Germany.
