Crude oil pipelines are primarily responsible for the transportation of crude oil from production sites to refineries or storage terminals. These pipelines are typically large-diameter, high-pressure pipelines designed to handle the constant flow of crude oil over long distances. They are vital for ensuring the steady supply of crude oil, which is a critical component of Germany's energy mix. With an extensive network of pipelines, Germany has built a reliable infrastructure for moving crude oil, supporting the energy security of the country and facilitating the international flow of oil within Europe.</p><p>Natural gas pipelines, on the other hand, play a crucial role in transporting natural gas from production facilities to distribution centers and consumers. These pipelines are generally smaller in diameter compared to crude oil pipelines but require advanced technology for compression and monitoring to maintain an efficient flow.
