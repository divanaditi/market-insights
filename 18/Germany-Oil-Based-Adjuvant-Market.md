Mineral oil-based adjuvants dominate the market due to their long-standing use and cost-effectiveness. These adjuvants are derived from petroleum products and are known for their ability to improve the efficacy of pesticides and herbicides. They enhance the spread and retention of active ingredients on plant surfaces, which is crucial for better pest control and more efficient crop protection. The cost-effective nature of mineral oil-based adjuvants contributes to their widespread adoption in agricultural practices, making them a popular choice among farmers and pesticide manufacturers. Moreover, mineral oils have a favorable environmental profile compared to synthetic chemicals, which adds to their appeal in the German market.</p><p>Vegetable oil-based adjuvants are gaining traction in Germany due to the growing demand for more environmentally friendly and sustainable agricultural practices. These adjuvants are typically made from natural plant oils such as soy, sunflower, or canola oil. Vegetable oil-based adjuvants offer similar benefits to mineral oil-based products in terms of improving the performance of pesticides and herbicides, but they are considered more eco-friendly. The use of renewable resources for their production helps reduce the overall environmental footprint of agricultural chemicals.
