One major segment is the use of Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS), which is widely adopted for continuous, real-time monitoring of various gases in the atmosphere. TDLAS offers high sensitivity and accuracy, making it ideal for tracking pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon dioxide (CO2), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This type of monitoring system is commonly utilized in industrial environments, urban areas, and environmental monitoring stations to ensure compliance with environmental regulations. Additionally, it enables quick detection of pollution levels, providing actionable data for mitigating air quality issues in Germany’s diverse urban and industrial sectors.</p><p>Another important segment in the market is the deployment of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) technology. FTIR systems are designed to monitor a broad spectrum of gases simultaneously, making them highly versatile for air quality analysis. These systems are used for both ambient air and emission measurements, contributing to environmental protection efforts in various industries such as chemicals, energy, and automotive manufacturing.
