Manual secateurs are the traditional hand-held cutting tools widely used by gardeners, landscapers, and horticulturists for pruning tasks. These tools are favored for their simplicity, lightweight design, and cost-effectiveness. The blades in manual secateurs are typically operated by a spring mechanism or a simple lever, which requires minimal maintenance. Their popularity remains high due to their durability, ease of use, and versatility in cutting a variety of plant stems and branches. They are ideal for light to moderate pruning tasks, which explains their demand in both domestic and commercial gardening applications across Germany. The manual secateurs market continues to dominate, especially in residential gardening segments, due to their affordability and long-lasting performance.<p>On the other hand, powered secateurs are gaining traction, particularly for more intensive and large-scale pruning operations.

Although they tend to have a higher upfront cost, their enhanced performance and ability to reduce user fatigue have made them a favored choice for commercial pruning tasks. Furthermore, the growing trend towards innovation and automation in the gardening sector has contributed to the rise of battery-powered and cordless models.
