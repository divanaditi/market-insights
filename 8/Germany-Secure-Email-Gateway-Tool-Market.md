On-premises secure email gateway tools offer businesses greater control over their email security infrastructure, ensuring that sensitive data does not leave the premises. This type is particularly favored by larger enterprises or those with strict regulatory compliance requirements.

These tools benefit from continuous updates and enhanced protection against emerging threats, as they are hosted on the cloud, reducing the need for physical infrastructure and internal maintenance. The adoption of cloud-based solutions is expected to grow rapidly due to the increasing shift towards digital transformation and the growing need for flexible and accessible security tools.<p>Furthermore, within the on-premises category, companies can choose from hardware-based or software-based solutions. Hardware-based solutions typically come with a physical appliance that acts as the primary point for email security, offering dedicated hardware resources for threat detection and filtering. Meanwhile, software-based solutions are more adaptable and can be installed on existing hardware, making them a more affordable choice for mid-sized enterprises.
