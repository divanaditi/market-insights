Traditional seasoned bread crumbs are made from dried bread and infused with various seasonings such as salt, pepper, garlic powder, and herbs. These bread crumbs are widely used in a range of culinary applications, from breading meat to coating vegetables for frying or baking. Due to their versatility, they are popular among both consumers and food service providers. Traditional seasoned bread crumbs cater to the demand for simple yet flavorful ingredients, offering a consistent texture and taste. They are often found in households and restaurants, as they add depth to recipes without overpowering the original flavors of the dishes.<p>Flavored seasoned bread crumbs, on the other hand, have gained popularity in the market due to the increasing preference for innovative and diverse flavors. These bread crumbs are enhanced with various ingredients like cheese, spicy seasonings, herbs, and even unique blends like smoked paprika or truffle. They are especially favored by consumers looking for more adventurous or gourmet options in their cooking. The growing trend of experimenting with flavors in everyday meals has led to a rise in demand for these flavored variants. These bread crumbs provide an enhanced taste profile, catering to a more specialized segment of the market that seeks to elevate the taste of their dishes.
