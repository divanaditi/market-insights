One prominent category includes flame-retardant wallpapers, which are engineered to reduce the risk of fire spreading in case of an emergency. These wallpapers are commonly used in residential and commercial buildings, particularly in areas with stringent safety regulations. The flame-retardant property of these wallpapers ensures that they meet safety standards while maintaining aesthetic appeal. Another type of fire-resistant wallpaper is those treated with specialized coatings that enhance fire-resistance without compromising the texture and design quality. These wallpapers are highly sought after for their practicality, offering both protection and design flexibility for various interior styles.</p><p>Additionally, the market also includes wallpapers with inherent fire-resistant properties, such as those made from natural fibers like glass fibers or metal-coated materials. These materials inherently resist combustion, offering enhanced protection in high-risk areas. Such wallpapers are often used in commercial spaces, such as hotels, offices, and public buildings, where fire safety is critical. The demand for these wallpapers is increasing due to rising awareness about fire safety regulations and an emphasis on integrating safety features into interior design.
