Steel cord, known for its superior strength and durability, is extensively used in the manufacturing of radial tires for both passenger vehicles and commercial trucks. Steel cord offers high resistance to wear and tear, contributing to the overall performance and longevity of the tires. This material's use is particularly favored in high-performance and heavy-duty tires, as it ensures better handling, stability, and load-bearing capacity. Furthermore, steel tire cords are resistant to corrosion, which adds to their value in the German automotive industry, particularly in regions where weather conditions are harsh. <p>On the other hand, nylon tire cords are used mainly in the production of bias tires. Nylon provides excellent flexibility, lightweight characteristics, and enhanced puncture resistance. It also offers good balance in terms of cost-efficiency, which makes it a preferred choice for manufacturing tires used in smaller vehicles and light-duty applications. Nylon tire cords are known for their ability to deliver a smooth and comfortable ride, especially in passenger vehicles. In comparison to steel, nylon cords are less stiff, making them ideal for tires that require better traction and enhanced ride comfort. The growing demand for fuel-efficient vehicles in Germany has led to an increase in the adoption of nylon tire cords, as they contribute to a reduction in rolling resistance and ultimately improve fuel economy.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/629172/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Tire Cord Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Tire Cord Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Tire Cord Market size was valued at USD 9.1 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 13.5 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.2% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Tire Cord Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Bekaert</Li><Li> Century Enka</Li><Li> CORDENKA</Li><Li> FORMOSA TAFFETA</Li><Li> Hyosung</Li><Li> Indorama Ventures Public</Li><Li> Kolon Industries</Li><Li> SRF</Li><Li> Teijin</Li><Li> Xingda International</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Tire Cord Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Tire Cord Market apart.
