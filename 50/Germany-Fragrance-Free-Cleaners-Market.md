Bathroom and kitchen cleaners, tailored for specific tasks, also contribute significantly to the market. They provide effective cleaning solutions while maintaining a fragrance-free formulation that appeals to individuals with allergies or asthma. Floor cleaners, often designed for wood, tile, or laminate surfaces, are another key category, providing an odorless yet effective solution for everyday cleaning needs.<p>In addition to these, specialty cleaners, including glass cleaners and surface wipes, are also gaining traction in the fragrance-free segment. Glass cleaners are popular for their streak-free finish, while surface wipes are used for convenient and quick cleaning, often in commercial or high-traffic environments. The demand for fragrance-free versions of these products is on the rise, as consumers increasingly seek options that reduce exposure to potential allergens. The market is driven by the growing awareness of environmental sustainability and the desire for non-toxic cleaning solutions.
