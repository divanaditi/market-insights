One of the prominent types is the kraft paper stand-up pouch, known for its eco-friendly characteristics and ability to maintain the freshness of rice products. These pouches are favored for their biodegradable nature and strength, making them a popular choice for packaging rice, especially among environmentally conscious consumers. The kraft paper variety offers a natural, rustic appearance, enhancing the product's appeal while supporting sustainable packaging solutions. They are also resistant to moisture and offer a high degree of sealing capability, ensuring the rice remains intact and fresh during transportation and storage.</p><p>Another type gaining traction in the German market is the laminated rice paper stand-up pouch.
