The most common type is the fixed safety bed rail, which is designed to be securely attached to the bed frame for added stability. These fixed models provide robust protection against falls, making them ideal for individuals who need consistent support, such as elderly or disabled users. They come in various sizes and materials, catering to different bed types and personal preferences. Fixed bed rails are typically easy to install and are highly effective in ensuring safety while sleeping or transitioning in and out of bed.</p><p>Another prominent type in the market is the adjustable safety bed rail. These models are versatile, allowing users to modify the height and width of the rail according to their specific requirements.
