Poultry feed holds a significant share in the market due to the high demand for chicken and other poultry products. Poultry feed is specifically formulated to meet the nutritional requirements of different stages of poultry growth, including broilers, layers, and breeders. This type of feed ensures optimal weight gain, health, and productivity in poultry farms. Additionally, advancements in feed formulations and the rise of premium and organic poultry products contribute to the increasing demand for specialized poultry feed in the country.</p><p>Cattle feed is another prominent segment within the German animal feed market, driven by the need for maintaining milk production and beef quality. Cattle feed includes a range of products like concentrates, silage, and forage to support the growth and lactation of dairy cattle and fattening of beef cattle. With Germany being one of the largest producers of dairy products in Europe, the demand for high-quality cattle feed remains strong. Swine feed, formulated to ensure healthy growth and high-quality meat production, is also a key segment.
