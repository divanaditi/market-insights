Optical splitters play a significant role in distributing light signals from a single input into multiple outputs. These devices are extensively used in fiber optic networks, particularly in applications involving passive optical networks (PONs). Their ability to support high bandwidth and low signal loss has made them crucial components in the telecommunications sector. Optical splitters are available in various configurations, including 1x2, 1x4, 1x8, and higher splitting ratios, catering to diverse network needs in Germany's growing fiber optic infrastructure.</p><p>On the other hand, optical combiners, which merge signals from multiple fibers into a single output, also play a critical role in the market. These devices are widely used in dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) systems, where they help optimize the usage of available fiber capacity by combining different wavelength signals.
