The most common types include capacitive, resistive, optical, and surface acoustic wave (SAW) touch sensors. Capacitive touch sensors dominate the market due to their high accuracy, responsiveness, and durability. They are widely used in consumer electronics such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops. Capacitive sensors offer a seamless user experience with multi-touch capabilities, which have driven their adoption across various devices. On the other hand, resistive touch sensors, while less expensive, are still favored in certain applications that require pressure-sensitive touch functionality. These sensors are typically used in industrial settings, kiosks, and automotive interfaces, where precise touch sensitivity under harsh conditions is needed.</p><p>Optical and surface acoustic wave (SAW) touch sensors are gaining traction in specific use cases. Optical sensors are ideal for large display applications, including interactive digital signage and public information systems, as they can support high-definition touch interaction without compromising display clarity.
