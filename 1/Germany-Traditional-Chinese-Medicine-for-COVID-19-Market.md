Herbal remedies have been widely used in TCM as natural treatments to boost immunity, alleviate symptoms, and speed up recovery from viral infections. These herbs, often combined into formulas, focus on enhancing the body’s defenses and treating the specific symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever, cough, and fatigue. The growing interest in alternative medicine during the pandemic has driven demand for these herbal solutions. Popular herbs such as ginger, ginseng, and astragalus are commonly included in these remedies, known for their anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immune-boosting properties. This segment is expected to witness significant growth due to an increasing preference for non-pharmaceutical options among consumers who are looking for holistic treatments for COVID-19 recovery.</p><p>Acupuncture and other TCM therapies such as moxibustion have also gained traction as complementary treatments for COVID-19 in Germany. Acupuncture works by stimulating specific points on the body to improve energy flow and promote healing, which is believed to help patients recover more effectively from the virus. Many individuals undergoing acupuncture seek relief from persistent symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and mental fog. Moxibustion, the practice of burning herbs near the skin to warm and invigorate the body, is also used to support respiratory function and boost immunity. While these therapies are less commonly used than herbal medicines, their market share has been growing due to their reputation for supporting the body’s natural healing processes. The segment of acupuncture and moxibustion is expected to continue expanding as patients increasingly look for integrative approaches to enhance recovery and well-being during and after COVID-19 infection.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/252838/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Traditional Chinese Medicine for COVID-19 Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Traditional Chinese Medicine for COVID-19 Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Traditional Chinese Medicine for COVID-19 Market size was valued at USD 1.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 5 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 19.8% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Traditional Chinese Medicine for COVID-19 Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Yiling Pharmaceutical</Li><Li> Chase Sun Pharmaceutical</Li><Li> Juxiechang Pharmaceutical</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Traditional Chinese Medicine for COVID-19 Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Traditional Chinese Medicine for COVID-19 Market apart.
