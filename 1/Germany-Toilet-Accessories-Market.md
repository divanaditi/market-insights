Toilet seat covers are a key segment, with demand driven by consumer preferences for enhanced hygiene and comfort. These covers are available in a range of materials such as plastic, cushioned, and heated variants, catering to different market needs. Toilet brushes, another important category, are commonly designed for ease of use and maintenance, often incorporating features like anti-bacterial coatings and ergonomic handles. Soap dispensers and storage solutions are increasingly popular in modern bathrooms, with consumers opting for sleek, functional designs to maintain an organized and hygienic space. The market sees a rise in demand for high-quality, durable products, especially those incorporating innovative features for enhanced user experience and long-term durability.<p>Additionally, the market is seeing growth in more specialized segments, including bidet attachments, toilet paper holders, and flushing systems.
