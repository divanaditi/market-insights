These kits include a wide variety of themes such as vehicles, aircraft, ships, and military models. The plastic model kits are popular due to their versatility, durability, and the level of detail they offer. Many hobbyists in Germany appreciate the intricate assembly process that allows them to replicate real-life vehicles and historical subjects. Additionally, these models are available in different difficulty levels, catering to both beginners and experienced enthusiasts. This segment has witnessed strong growth due to the increasing demand for collectible items and the popularity of model building as a hobby. The second significant segment in the market is the metal model kits, which have gained traction due to their robust construction and precision. These kits are often seen as higher-end products, offering enhanced durability and a premium building experience.
