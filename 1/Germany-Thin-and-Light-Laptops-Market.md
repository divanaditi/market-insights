Ultra-portable laptops are designed to offer portability without sacrificing essential performance features. These laptops typically weigh less than 2kg, making them ideal for professionals and students who require mobility without compromising on processing power. On the other hand, ultrabooks are ultra-thin and feature high-performance processors, long battery life, and premium designs, catering to business executives and tech-savvy users who demand efficiency on the go. These laptops typically have slim profiles and are equipped with fast storage options like SSDs to enhance overall user experience and productivity.</p><p>Convertible laptops are another key segment within the market.

Often equipped with touchscreens and rotating hinges, convertible laptops are popular among those who require both a laptop and tablet experience in one device. This versatility makes them suitable for a wide range of users, from business professionals to creative individuals.
