Bifurcated stent grafts are commonly used in cases where the aorta branches into two vessels, typically for patients with more complex aortic diseases. These devices allow for the repair of the aortic aneurysm while maintaining blood flow to the branches of the aorta. The growing prevalence of aortic aneurysms and other vascular conditions in Germany has driven the demand for bifurcated stent grafts, especially in patients requiring multi-branch endovascular repair procedures. Their ability to treat a variety of complex cases contributes to the increasing adoption in clinical settings.<p>On the other hand, straight stent grafts are used for repairing aortic aneurysms or dissections in patients with a straight section of the aorta. These devices are simpler in design and are typically used in less complicated cases, where the aorta does not have branching vessels in the affected area. The demand for straight stent grafts in Germany is significant due to the high volume of aortic diseases that can be treated with this device type. Their relatively straightforward application, cost-effectiveness, and ability to address less complex aneurysms have made them a preferred choice in many procedures, contributing to their growing market share in the region.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/258638/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Thoracic Stent Graft System Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Thoracic Stent Graft System Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Thoracic Stent Graft System Market size was valued at USD 1.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.7 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 8.2% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Thoracic Stent Graft System Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Medtronic</Li><Li> JOTEC</Li><Li> Kawasumi Laboratories</Li><Li> Terumo Aortic</Li><Li> MicroPort</Li><Li> VuMedi</Li><Li> W.
