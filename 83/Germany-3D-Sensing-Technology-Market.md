Structured light technology uses a projector to display a known pattern on an object, allowing for precise depth measurements. This technology is particularly favored in applications like facial recognition, augmented reality, and industrial automation. Time-of-flight technology, on the other hand, measures the time it takes for light to travel to an object and back, providing accurate 3D data for short-range to long-range applications. ToF sensors are commonly used in mobile devices, automotive systems, and robotics, where accurate distance measurements are crucial for efficient operations. Stereo vision utilizes two or more cameras to capture images from different angles, generating depth perception. This technique is prevalent in applications such as autonomous vehicles and robotics, where spatial awareness is essential for decision-making.<p>The adoption of 3D sensing technologies in Germany is driven by the increasing demand for enhanced user experiences in consumer electronics and the rising need for automation in industrial processes. Structured light sensors are widely used in smartphones and gaming devices for their high precision and reliability. ToF sensors are also gaining significant traction due to their ability to provide real-time 3D mapping and gesture recognition, which is crucial in industries like automotive and robotics.
