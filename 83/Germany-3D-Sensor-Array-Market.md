Optical sensors are primarily used in applications requiring precise depth perception and are favored for their high accuracy in capturing 3D data. These sensors operate by emitting light and analyzing the reflected signals to map the spatial environment. On the other hand, infrared sensors are increasingly popular in industrial automation and automotive sectors for proximity detection and movement tracking. They work by emitting infrared light and detecting the variations in the reflected light to create 3D representations of objects. Lastly, ultrasonic sensors operate by emitting high-frequency sound waves and measuring their reflection, making them useful in applications like robotics, automotive parking systems, and medical diagnostics, where non-invasive and precise measurement is crucial.<p>Additionally, these sensor types differ in terms of application, cost, and performance. Optical sensors offer the ultimate accuracy in capturing detailed surface structures but are more expensive and may require more processing power. Infrared sensors, while not as precise as optical sensors, are more cost-effective and well-suited for applications requiring medium-level accuracy.
