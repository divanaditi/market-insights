One of the prominent types is the column-assist EPS, where the electric motor is placed on the steering column to provide assistance directly to the steering mechanism. This type is widely used in small to mid-sized vehicles due to its compact design and efficiency. The column-assist system allows for a smoother driving experience and is more energy-efficient compared to traditional hydraulic power steering systems. It has gained significant popularity in compact and subcompact cars due to its reduced weight and cost-effectiveness, making it a preferred choice among automakers in Germany. As more automakers adopt energy-efficient technologies, the demand for column-assist EPS continues to rise, contributing to the growth of the market in the region.</p><p>Another major type is the rack-assist EPS, which integrates the electric motor into the steering rack. This type of system offers better performance and precision, as the motor directly assists the steering rack’s movement. Rack-assist EPS is becoming increasingly popular in larger vehicles and high-performance cars, where greater steering control and responsiveness are required. With technological advancements, the system has improved in terms of handling and feedback, providing a more natural steering feel for drivers. The growing demand for advanced driving dynamics and safety features has fueled the adoption of rack-assist EPS in the German automotive market. This system is expected to gain significant traction in premium and luxury car segments, further driving the growth of the electric power steer</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/492820/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Electric Power Steering Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Electric Power Steering Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Electric Power Steering Market size was valued at USD 20.54 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 34.56 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.95% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Electric Power Steering Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>JteKT</Li><Li> Nexteer</Li><Li> ZF</Li><Li> Bosch</Li><Li> NSK</Li><Li> Hyundai Mobis</Li><Li> Showa</Li><Li> Delphi</Li><Li> Thyssenkrupp</Li><Li> Mitsubishi Electric</Li><Li> GKN</Li><Li> Federal Mogul</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Electric Power Steering Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Electric Power Steering Market apart.
