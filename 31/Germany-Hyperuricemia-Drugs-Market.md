Xanthine oxidase inhibitors are the most widely prescribed class of drugs used to manage hyperuricemia, as they work by reducing the production of uric acid in the body. Allopurinol and febuxostat are the key drugs in this category, with a significant market share due to their effectiveness in controlling uric acid levels. These drugs are often the first line of treatment for hyperuricemia and gout, making them a dominant force in the German market. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors are recommended for long-term management and are considered safe and efficient in reducing the frequency of gout flare-ups and preventing kidney stones caused by high uric acid levels.</p><p>Uricosurics, the second major segment, work by increasing the excretion of uric acid through the kidneys. These drugs, including probenecid and benzbromarone, are prescribed when xanthine oxidase inhibitors are not effective or tolerated. Uricosurics are typically used in patients with poor renal function or when there is an insufficient response to allopurinol. Although the use of uricosuric agents is less common compared to xanthine oxidase inhibitors, they offer a valuable alternative in the treatment of hyperuricemia. In the German market, the adoption of uricosurics is growing, as these drugs provide an option for patients with specific medical conditions and treatment needs, enhancing the overall diversity of available treatment regimens for managing hyperuricemia and gout in the country.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/492530/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Hyperuricemia Drugs Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Hyperuricemia Drugs Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Hyperuricemia Drugs Market size was valued at USD 4.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 7.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Hyperuricemia Drugs Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Pfizer Inc</Li><Li> F.
