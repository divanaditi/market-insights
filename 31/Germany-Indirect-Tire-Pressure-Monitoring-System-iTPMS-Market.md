The OEM segment is driven by automotive manufacturers integrating iTPMS as a standard or optional feature in new vehicles. The rise of government regulations mandating the inclusion of tire pressure monitoring systems in vehicles has accelerated the adoption of iTPMS in the OEM sector. With advancements in automotive technology and an increasing focus on safety and fuel efficiency, OEMs are opting for iTPMS as a cost-effective solution to monitor tire pressure. This type of system uses the vehicle's existing wheel speed sensors to detect variations in tire pressure, providing real-time data to the driver. As demand for new vehicles grows, the OEM market is expected to expand steadily in Germany, contributing significantly to the overall market growth.</p><p>The aftermarket segment is gaining traction as vehicle owners seek to upgrade or retrofit their vehicles with iTPMS for enhanced safety and performance. This segment is characterized by the availability of a wide range of iTPMS solutions for different vehicle models. Aftermarket iTPMS systems are typically more affordable and offer flexible options for consumers, especially those with older vehicle models that lack integrated systems. With increasing awareness of tire-related safety issues and rising fuel costs, more consumers are opting for aftermarket installations. The ease of installation and the ability to improve vehicle safety without purchasing a new car contribute to the popularity of iTPMS in the aftermarket sector. Additionally, the growing number of independent automotive service centers offering installation and maintenance services supports the expansion of the aftermarket iTPMS market in Germany.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/486426/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System (iTPMS) Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System (iTPMS) Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System (iTPMS) Market size was valued at USD 3.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 5.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System (iTPMS) Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Schrader (Sensata)</Li><Li> Continental</Li><Li> ZF</Li><Li> Pacific Industrial</Li><Li> Huf</Li><Li> Baolong Automotive</Li><Li> Bendix</Li><Li> Denso</Li><Li> NIRA Dynamics</Li><Li> CUB Elecparts</Li><Li> Steelmate</Li><Li> Shenzhen Autotech</Li><Li> Nanjing Top Sun</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System (iTPMS) Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System (iTPMS) Market apart.
