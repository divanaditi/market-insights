Voice-only services focus primarily on voice calls, enabling users to make phone calls over the internet, bypassing traditional telecom networks. These services are popular for their cost-effectiveness, as they provide an alternative to traditional mobile services. With the increasing adoption of smartphones and reliable internet connections, voice-only mobile VoIP services are gaining traction among individuals and businesses looking for a more affordable option to stay connected. This type of VoIP service is particularly beneficial for international calls, offering users significant savings compared to conventional mobile plans.</p><p>On the other hand, multimedia VoIP services offer a broader range of communication features, including voice calls, video calls, instant messaging, and file sharing. These services provide users with a comprehensive communication solution, facilitating both personal and professional interactions. Multimedia VoIP platforms are especially popular in business environments, where face-to-face meetings, team collaboration, and seamless communication are critical. The growth of 5G networks and high-speed internet is expected to further boost the demand for multimedia VoIP services in Germany, making them a prominent segment of the market.
