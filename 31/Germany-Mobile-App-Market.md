Gaming apps have consistently held a significant share of the market, driven by a large and diverse user base of all ages. The increasing popularity of mobile gaming titles, along with advancements in mobile technology that allow for enhanced gaming experiences, has contributed to the growth of this segment. Moreover, the rise of casual gaming and the availability of free-to-play games with in-app purchases have attracted a wide range of users, resulting in sustained demand for gaming apps in the country.</p><p>Non-gaming apps, which include a wide variety of applications such as social media, e-commerce, productivity, health and fitness, and entertainment, represent another key segment of the market. The demand for these apps has grown steadily due to changing consumer lifestyles and the integration of mobile technology into daily routines.
