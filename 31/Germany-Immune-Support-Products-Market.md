Dietary supplements, including vitamins, minerals, and herbs, represent a significant portion of the market due to their popularity in boosting immune health. Consumers are increasingly turning to supplements like vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc to enhance immunity, especially in response to health concerns and lifestyle changes. The growing awareness around preventive healthcare is driving the demand for these products. Additionally, there has been an increase in the consumption of herbal supplements, as natural remedies gain traction among health-conscious individuals. The convenience of dietary supplements, which are available in easy-to-consume formats such as tablets, capsules, and powders, further contributes to their widespread use in Germany.</p><p>Functional foods are another key segment in the Germany immune support products market. These products, which include fortified foods and beverages, are designed to provide additional health benefits beyond basic nutrition. Functional foods such as probiotic yogurts, fortified juices, and immune-boosting snacks are becoming increasingly popular as consumers seek foods that support their overall wellness. With a rising focus on immunity and holistic health, more German consumers are opting for foods that contain added vitamins, minerals, and probiotics. This trend is expected to continue as the demand for products that promote long-term health and immunity grows.
