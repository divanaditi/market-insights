Vitamins such as Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and Vitamin E are highly sought after, as they are essential for boosting immune function. Vitamin C, in particular, is known for its ability to support the immune system in fighting off infections and reducing inflammation. Similarly, Vitamin D plays a critical role in enhancing the immune response, especially during colder months when sunlight exposure is limited. Minerals like zinc and selenium are also key contributors to the immune-boosting process, as they help in maintaining healthy immune cells and improving the body's natural defenses against diseases.</p><p>Another significant segment in the market is herbal supplements, which have gained immense popularity due to their natural properties. Popular herbs such as echinacea, elderberry, and garlic are often used to strengthen the immune system. These herbal remedies are preferred for their perceived safety and fewer side effects compared to synthetic products. Echinacea is believed to enhance the body's ability to fight infections, while elderberry is commonly used to reduce the severity and duration of colds. Garlic, with its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, is widely recognized for supporting overall immunity and reducing the risk of infections. This growing trend towards plant-based and natural immunity supplements has significantly impacted the market in Germany.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/488678/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Immunity Supplements Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Immunity Supplements Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Immunity Supplements Market size was valued at USD 32.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 56.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.4% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Immunity Supplements Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Amway</Li><Li> INFINITUS</Li><Li> Herbalife Nutrition</Li><Li> DEEJ</Li><Li> Usana</Li><Li> Blackmores</Li><Li> PERFECT</Li><Li> Swisse</Li><Li> China New Era Group</Li><Li> By-health</Li><Li> Suntory</Li><Li> Pfizer</Li><Li> Beijing Tong Ren Tang</Li><Li> Shanghai Pharma</Li><Li> TIENS</Li><Li> GNC</Li><Li> Real Nutriceutical</Li><Li> Southernature</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Immunity Supplements Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Immunity Supplements Market apart.
