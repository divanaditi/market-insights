Kraft paper is used for wrapping and small tubs, particularly in premium or sustainable packaging lines. Other paper packaging options include parchment paper and specialty coatings, which are tailored for specific applications such as individual servings or special promotions. The trend toward sustainability is influencing the selection of packaging materials in the ice cream sector, with a growing shift toward recyclable and biodegradable solutions.<p>Furthermore, the design and customization of ice cream paper packaging have become crucial factors in the German market. Companies are opting for various finishes, such as glossy, matte, or embossed surfaces, to enhance the visual appeal of their products. This segmentation also includes packaging used for cones, which require different paper specifications for durability and moisture protection. The rise in demand for premium and artisanal ice cream products has further propelled the need for high-end, custom-designed paper packaging. Additionally, innovations in barrier coatings are being explored to improve the packaging’s resistance to condensation and maintain product integrity.
