Therapeutic apheresis involves the removal of specific components from a patient's blood to treat various medical conditions such as autoimmune disorders, renal failure, and certain types of cancer. This segment is witnessing a steady growth in demand due to increasing awareness of its efficacy in managing chronic diseases. It also benefits from the advancement of apheresis technologies, which enable more precise and safer procedures, making therapeutic apheresis an essential treatment option for patients with complex medical needs.</p><p>On the other hand, donor apheresis is focused on the collection of blood components from healthy individuals for transfusions or medical use. This segment includes the collection of platelets, plasma, and red blood cells. The rising need for blood and blood components in Germany, driven by an aging population and the increasing prevalence of conditions requiring blood transfusions, is fueling the demand for donor apheresis. Additionally, the growth of donation programs and improved donor recruitment strategies have bolstered this market segment.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/486196/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Apheresis Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Apheresis Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Apheresis Market size was valued at USD 2.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 5.1 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 9.9% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Apheresis Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Asahi Kasei Medical</Li><Li> Terumo Corporation</Li><Li> Haemonetics Corporation</Li><Li> Fresenius Kabi</Li><Li> Cerus Corporation</Li><Li> B.
