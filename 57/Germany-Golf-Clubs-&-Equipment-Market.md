Additionally, wedges and putters play a crucial role in short-game performance, with specialized designs improving precision and accuracy on the green. The growing demand for custom-fitted clubs also reflects a shift toward personalized equipment tailored to individual playing styles and preferences, enhancing the overall golfing experience.<p>In addition to golf clubs, the market includes a range of other equipment types, such as golf balls, bags, gloves, and apparel. Golf balls, a critical part of the game, come in various specifications, such as distance balls and spin control models, each designed to suit different playing conditions and skill levels. Golf bags, which range from lightweight stand bags to large cart bags, are increasingly designed for comfort and convenience, with modern features like waterproofing and ample storage space. Gloves and apparel, designed for both performance and style, further complement the golfing experience.
