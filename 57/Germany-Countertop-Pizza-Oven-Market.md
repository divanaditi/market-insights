Convection ovens are designed to circulate hot air around the pizza, ensuring an even and quick cooking process. This type is highly favored for home use, as it offers versatility, energy efficiency, and ease of use. Convection ovens also provide the flexibility to cook a variety of foods, making them ideal for smaller kitchens and residential settings. Their popularity is growing due to their compact size, affordability, and ability to deliver consistent results, even for larger or thicker crust pizzas. Many consumers appreciate the convenience of these ovens as they are user-friendly and easy to clean, contributing to the increasing demand in the German market.<p>On the other hand, conveyor pizza ovens are a common choice for commercial applications in Germany. These ovens work by continuously moving the pizza through a heated conveyor belt, ensuring that the pizza is cooked uniformly and quickly. This type of oven is typically used in pizzerias, restaurants, and foodservice establishments where high-volume pizza production is essential. Conveyor ovens are known for their efficiency, speed, and ability to handle large orders with minimal oversight. As demand for fast-casual dining increases, conveyor ovens are gaining traction in both large and small establishments across the country.
