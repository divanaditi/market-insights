Consumers in this segment prioritize comfort and performance, often choosing items based on the type of exercise they engage in. With an increasing focus on fitness and wellness, activewear remains a major driver in the market, attracting both professional athletes and fitness enthusiasts alike.</p><p>Athleisure, on the other hand, refers to sportswear that seamlessly integrates into casual and everyday fashion, allowing consumers to wear them beyond fitness activities. Athleisure garments are designed to be versatile, stylish, and functional, offering comfort and flexibility for daily wear. This segment has grown rapidly in Germany, driven by a trend toward more relaxed and active lifestyles. Popular athleisure items include leggings, hoodies, sports jackets, and sneakers, which cater to the growing demand for multi-functional clothing. Athleisure appeals to a broad demographic, from young professionals to older consumers, due to its stylish yet comfortable nature.
