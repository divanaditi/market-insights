Their availability in various retail outlets and online platforms also contributes to their growing demand in the German market. The ease of installation and low cost further enhances their appeal, especially among budget-conscious customers looking for functional home décor options.</p><p>On the other hand, custom-made curtains are tailored to fit specific window dimensions and customer preferences, offering a more personalized touch. This type of curtain is gaining traction among homeowners and interior designers who prioritize style, quality, and uniqueness. Custom curtains often use premium fabrics and are designed to complement individual room aesthetics.
