Plastic labels, including PVC, PET, and polypropylene, are gaining traction due to their durability and resistance to moisture, making them ideal for labeling products in harsh environmental conditions. Metal labels, though less common, cater to high-end applications where durability, aesthetic appeal, and premium branding are essential, such as in automotive and luxury goods packaging.<p>The market segmentation also includes adhesive and non-adhesive labels, with adhesive labels being the most widely used in the industry. These labels are favored for their easy application and strong adhesion properties, which make them suitable for a variety of surfaces such as bottles, containers, and electronic products. Non-adhesive labels, though less prominent, serve niche applications in industries such as textiles and healthcare. Furthermore, the growing demand for sustainable labeling solutions is driving innovation within these categories, with biodegradable and recyclable materials emerging as key trends.
