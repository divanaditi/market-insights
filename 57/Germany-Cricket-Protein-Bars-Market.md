This type of protein bar offers a high concentration of protein, fiber, and essential amino acids, making it a preferred choice among health-conscious consumers. Whole cricket flour is a sustainable source of nutrition, and its use in protein bars aligns with the growing demand for environmentally friendly and alternative protein sources. These bars typically appeal to athletes, fitness enthusiasts, and those seeking clean-label, nutrient-dense snacks.</p><p>Another segment of the market includes bars made with cricket protein isolate, which contains a higher percentage of protein by removing excess fats and carbohydrates.
