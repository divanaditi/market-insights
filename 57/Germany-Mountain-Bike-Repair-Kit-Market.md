One major type includes the basic repair kits, which are designed for everyday cyclists who require essential tools for quick fixes on the go. These kits typically contain items like tire levers, patch kits, mini-pumps, and chain tools. The compact nature of these repair kits makes them highly portable and convenient for cyclists who want to carry minimal gear but still have the tools needed for common issues. These kits are particularly popular among casual riders and urban cyclists who mainly use their bikes for commuting or leisure riding.</p><p>Another key type in the market is the advanced repair kits, which are more comprehensive and geared toward serious bikers and those participating in mountain biking or long-distance touring. These kits often include high-quality, durable tools like torque wrenches, chain breakers, and multi-tools. Advanced repair kits also tend to be larger and may come in rugged cases designed to withstand tough conditions.
