Among these, skinny denim pants hold a dominant share due to the growing preference for form-fitting styles in contemporary fashion. This trend is largely driven by young consumers who are inclined toward trendy and stylish clothing options. Skinny jeans offer versatility and can be easily paired with various tops, making them a popular choice for both casual and semi-formal occasions.

These types provide more freedom of movement and are perceived as more timeless compared to skinny jeans. The relaxed fit denim pants segment is gaining momentum as well, catering to those who prioritize comfort and practicality without compromising on style.
