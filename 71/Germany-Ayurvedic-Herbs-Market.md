The market is segmented by types, with some of the most prominent categories being herbs for digestive health, immune system support, stress relief, and skin care. Digestive health herbs like ginger and turmeric are widely used for their ability to soothe the digestive tract and enhance nutrient absorption. Additionally, herbs such as ashwagandha and holy basil are popular for boosting immunity and managing stress. These herbs have garnered attention for their adaptogenic properties, which help the body manage stress and support overall wellness. As more consumers turn to holistic solutions for health and wellness, the demand for Ayurvedic herbs that provide specific health benefits is expected to rise.<p>On the other hand, herbs used for skin care, such as neem and aloe vera, are also playing a crucial role in the growing market. These herbs are known for their anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, making them highly sought after in the skincare and beauty industry. With increasing consumer preference for organic and plant-based skincare products, the demand for Ayurvedic herbs in cosmetic applications is on the rise. Moreover, herbs like Brahmi and Shatavari are also gaining popularity for their cognitive benefits and hormonal balancing properties, respectively.
