Another key type is credit and debit card payments, which remain popular for cross-border transactions due to their widespread use and global acceptance. These payments are supported by robust security protocols, making them reliable for both merchants and customers. Additionally, bank transfers play an essential role, especially for larger transactions, offering higher transaction limits and formalized security measures.
