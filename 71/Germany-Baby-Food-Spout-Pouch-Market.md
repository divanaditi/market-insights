Another significant type includes vegetable-based baby food pouches, which cater to the growing demand for healthy, plant-based meals. These pouches often feature a mix of vegetables like carrots, peas, and spinach, designed to provide essential nutrients in a convenient format. Additionally, there are mixed fruit and vegetable pouches, which combine the nutritional benefits of both food groups in a single package, appealing to parents who seek variety in their baby’s diet.

Organic and gluten-free options are also gaining traction, reflecting the increasing trend of health-conscious parents opting for chemical-free, allergen-free products for their babies. Dairy-based baby food pouches, containing pureed or strained dairy products like yogurt, are another prominent segment, catering to babies who have transitioned to more solid food types. The rise of plant-based diets also promotes the inclusion of vegan-friendly pouches, making it easier for parents to find products that meet their dietary preferences.
