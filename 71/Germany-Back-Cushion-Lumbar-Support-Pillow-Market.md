Memory foam pillows offer targeted support to the lower back, promoting good posture and reducing discomfort during long periods of sitting. Another significant material is polyester, which is used for its affordability and durability. Polyester pillows are lightweight and easy to maintain, making them a popular choice for budget-conscious consumers. The market also includes other materials such as cotton and polyurethane, each offering unique benefits in terms of comfort and support. These material-based categories cater to a broad range of consumer preferences, with varying price points and features designed to meet diverse needs for lumbar support. <p>In addition to material types, the Germany back cushion lumbar support pillow market is also segmented by the design of the pillows. Traditional wedge-shaped pillows are popular for their simple yet effective design, providing consistent support for the lower back. These pillows are typically used in office chairs, car seats, and home seating arrangements.
