Toothbrushes designed for babies are a key product category, offering soft bristles and ergonomic handles for easy use. These toothbrushes are typically designed to ensure comfort while cleaning delicate gums and early teeth. Additionally, baby toothpaste, which is fluoride-free and safe for ingestion, is an essential product to protect young teeth and gums. Such products are made with mild flavors to encourage children to develop good brushing habits from an early age. Teething gels and other oral care items for soothing gum discomfort are also popular, as they offer relief for babies experiencing teething pain.Another significant segment in the market includes dental wipes and cleaning cloths. These products help parents maintain oral hygiene for babies who have not yet developed a full set of teeth.
