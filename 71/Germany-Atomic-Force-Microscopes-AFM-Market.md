Contact AFM is one of the most widely used types, offering high resolution imaging of surface topography at the nanoscale. This type operates by physically tapping or pressing the microscope’s probe on the surface to collect data. Contact AFM is particularly suitable for studying hard materials or solid surfaces, where high precision measurements of surface roughness and structure are required. This makes it a popular choice across industries like materials science, electronics, and biology. As technological advancements continue to improve its resolution, contact AFM remains integral to research and development applications in Germany’s growing scientific landscape.</p><p>Non-contact AFM, on the other hand, is used primarily for delicate samples that might be damaged by direct contact. This technique measures the forces between the probe and the surface at a distance, without physical interaction, making it ideal for soft materials, biological samples, and polymers. Non-contact AFM provides high-resolution topographical images with minimal disturbance to the sample, which is crucial in applications within the fields of nanotechnology, biomaterials, and semiconductor research. The demand for non-contact AFM is rising due to its ability to handle a diverse range of materials and provide more accurate measurements in sensitive environments. The ability to operate at higher scanning speeds also contributes to its increasing popularity in Germany’s expanding AFM market.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/797452/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Atomic Force Microscopes (AFM) Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Atomic Force Microscopes (AFM) Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Atomic Force Microscopes (AFM) Market size was valued at USD 478.0 Million in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 760.0 Million by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.0% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Atomic Force Microscopes (AFM) Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Bruker Corporation</Li><Li> JPK Instruments</Li><Li> NT-MDT</Li><Li> Keysight Technologies</Li><Li> Park Systems</Li><Li> Witec</Li><Li> Asylum Research(Oxford Instruments)</Li><Li> Nanonics Imaging</Li><Li> Nanosurf</Li><Li> Hitachi High-Technologies</Li><Li> Anasys Instruments</Li><Li> RHK Technology</Li><Li> A.P.E.
