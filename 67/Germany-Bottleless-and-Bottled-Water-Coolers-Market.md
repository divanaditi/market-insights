Moreover, bottleless water coolers are equipped with advanced filtration technologies, offering purified water at all times, which appeals to health-conscious individuals. The market's growth is also supported by the increasing demand for workplace wellness solutions, with many companies opting for bottleless coolers to provide fresh, filtered water to their employees in an environmentally responsible manner.</p><p>On the other hand, the bottled water coolers segment remains a dominant player in the German market, particularly in residential and small business settings.
