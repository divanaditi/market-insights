Solid brass wire is typically used for creating durable, high-quality components in clothing accessories such as buttons, zippers, and fasteners.

The solid brass wire offers strength and reliability, ensuring the longevity of the accessories in which it is used. Its aesthetic appeal, combined with functionality, makes it a preferred material for high-end fashion accessories in Germany.</p><p>On the other hand, braided brass wire is another significant type within the market, often used for creating intricate designs and flexible components. Braided brass wire is known for its flexibility, which allows it to be molded into various shapes, offering a unique design element to clothing accessories. It is commonly found in chains, necklaces, and decorative trims. The braided wire also provides excellent tensile strength and resistance to wear, which is crucial for fashion accessories that require movement and elasticity.
