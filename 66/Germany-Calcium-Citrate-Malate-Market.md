It is also commonly used in the food and beverage industry, where it is added to supplements and functional foods. The demand for powder-based calcium citrate malate is growing due to its easy incorporation into various applications, from dietary supplements to fortified products, driven by a growing awareness of bone health and nutritional deficiencies among the German population. This segment benefits from the flexibility in formulation and the ability to be rapidly absorbed into the body, contributing to its increasing popularity.<p>On the other hand, the tablet segment of the Germany Calcium Citrate Malate market remains a strong preference for consumers who seek convenience and precision in dosing.
