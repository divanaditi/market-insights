Self-expanding stent grafts dominate the market due to their enhanced flexibility and ease of deployment. These stents are made from materials such as nitinol, which allows them to expand automatically when placed in the artery. This feature makes them ideal for treating peripheral artery diseases, where precise placement and gradual expansion are essential for optimal results. The self-expanding design also helps to reduce complications related to vessel trauma during the implantation process, leading to higher adoption rates in medical procedures across Germany. These stents are widely used for treating aortic aneurysms, femoral, and iliac artery blockages, making them a preferred choice for vascular surgeons in the country.</p><p>Balloon-expandable stent grafts, while less common than self-expanding models, also maintain a significant presence in the market. These stents require a balloon catheter to expand to their final size after placement in the vessel. They are typically preferred for use in smaller or more challenging blood vessels where precise, controlled expansion is necessary. Balloon-expandable stent grafts provide a more rigid structure, making them suitable for areas where greater mechanical support is needed. Although they require more complex procedural steps for implantation, their robust design ensures long-term patency and improved clinical outcomes, particularly in high-risk patients. In Germany, balloon-expandable stent grafts continue to be a reliable choice for specific applications, contributing to the ongoing growth of the peripheral stent graft system market.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/372128/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Peripheral Stent Graft System Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Peripheral Stent Graft System Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Peripheral Stent Graft System Market size was valued at USD 2.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 4.0 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Peripheral Stent Graft System Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Getinge</Li><Li> BD</Li><Li> JOTEC GmbH</Li><Li> W.
