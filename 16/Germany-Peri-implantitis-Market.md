Surgical treatments include various invasive procedures, such as bone grafting, flap surgery, and the use of guided bone regeneration to restore the damaged bone structure around implants. These methods are often preferred when the infection has caused significant bone loss, requiring extensive intervention. The growing demand for advanced surgical procedures, supported by technological advancements like laser therapy and regenerative techniques, is driving the market for surgical treatments. Hospitals and specialized clinics offer these procedures, which are associated with higher costs but provide effective solutions for severe cases of peri-implantitis.</p><p>Non-surgical treatments, on the other hand, are less invasive and typically used for early-stage peri-implantitis. These include scaling and root planing, antibiotics, antimicrobial therapy, and the use of antiseptic agents to control the infection. Non-surgical options are generally more affordable and can be performed in a dental clinic with less recovery time. As awareness about preventive care grows, the demand for non-surgical treatments has been increasing, as they offer a less invasive alternative for managing mild peri-implantitis cases. The preference for non-surgical treatments is expected to contribute significantly to market growth in Germany, as they provide a balance between efficacy and cost-efficiency for patients with early-stage implant complications.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/372346/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Peri-implantitis Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Peri-implantitis Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Peri-implantitis Market size was valued at USD 1.35 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.10 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.05% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Peri-implantitis Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Pfizer Inc.</Li><Li> Cadila Pharmaceuticals</Li><Li> R.N.
