Among the key types, over-the-needle catheters (ONC) are widely used due to their ease of insertion and cost-effectiveness. These catheters are often employed for short-term access, such as during surgeries or for diagnostic procedures. Another prominent type is the closed-system catheter, which minimizes the risk of contamination by using a sealed design. These catheters are generally favored in hospital settings, especially in intensive care units, for their ability to prevent infection. The market also features midline catheters, which are longer than standard peripheral catheters and are preferred for intermediate-term access, typically used for infusions or blood sampling over extended periods. Each of these catheter types caters to specific clinical needs, reflecting the diverse demands of healthcare providers in Germany.</p><p>In addition to these core categories, the market also includes winged infusion sets, which are commonly utilized for venous access in both adults and pediatric patients. These catheters are designed with flexible wings that help stabilize the catheter during insertion, reducing the likelihood of dislodgement. Additionally, the emergence of safety-engineered catheters has significantly impacted the market, with a growing preference for products designed to minimize needlestick injuries. These devices often feature built-in safety mechanisms, such as automatic needle shields, that enhance both patient and healthcare worker safety. The increasing awareness of infection control and patient safety is likely to drive the demand for such advanced catheter types in the German market. As the healthcare sector evolves, the ongoing development of more sophisticated, user-friendly, and safer peripheral venous catheters is expected to shape market trends in the coming years.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/372098/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Peripheral Venous Catheter Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Peripheral Venous Catheter Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Peripheral Venous Catheter Market size was valued at USD 3.12 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 4.87 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Peripheral Venous Catheter Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>GaltNeedleTech</Li><Li> Hospira</Li><Li> Vigmed</Li><Li> B.
