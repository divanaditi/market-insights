Among the most popular types are traditional Persian rugs, which are often handwoven using ancient techniques.

Hand-knotted rugs, which dominate the market, remain highly sought after for their craftsmanship and detailed patterns. The demand for these authentic Persian pieces continues to grow, particularly among collectors and interior designers. Additionally, machine-made rugs, though not as traditional, are gaining popularity due to their affordability and availability. These rugs are typically produced on a larger scale and are accessible to a broader audience while still maintaining an aesthetic appeal that suits modern and contemporary interior spaces.<p>The market also sees a strong preference for specific styles of Persian rugs, such as the Tabriz, Isfahan, and Kashan, each representing a unique regional artistry that contributes to the overall diversity in design. Tabriz rugs, known for their bold patterns and vibrant colors, have a notable presence, appealing to those looking for a statement piece. Isfahan rugs, characterized by their delicate weaving and fine craftsmanship, often attract high-end buyers. Kashan rugs, with their intricate floral motifs, cater to more classic tastes. Over time, consumer demand in Germany has expanded beyond the traditional, with a growing interest in modern designs and more sustainable rug-making processes, creating a dynamic landscape within the Persian rug market.
