Stationary disinfection channels are fixed installations commonly found in high-traffic areas such as airports, hospitals, and factories. These systems are designed for long-term use, providing continuous disinfection of individuals entering and exiting these premises. Stationary systems often include advanced features such as automated sanitization, temperature monitoring, and air purification, making them ideal for environments where hygiene is critical. Their efficiency in high-volume operations ensures consistent disinfection, which is crucial for maintaining strict health standards across various industries. These channels also tend to have a higher initial setup cost but provide long-lasting performance with minimal maintenance.<p>On the other hand, mobile disinfection channels are portable units that offer flexibility for temporary or changing disinfection needs. These systems are designed to be easily set up and relocated, making them ideal for use at events, construction sites, or other areas where stationary units may not be feasible. Mobile disinfection channels are typically less expensive to deploy than their stationary counterparts, and they can be used in a wide range of settings. These units are often equipped with features such as automatic sanitizing sprays, UV-C light, and thermal scanning to ensure effective personnel disinfection on the move.
