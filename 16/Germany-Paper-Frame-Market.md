Their versatility makes them a popular choice for households, offices, and retail establishments. The demand for traditional paper frames continues to be driven by consumer preferences for affordability and the extensive range of design options available.</p><p>Eco-friendly paper frames, on the other hand, have been gaining traction in the German market as sustainability becomes an increasingly important consideration among consumers. Made from recycled or biodegradable materials, these frames cater to the growing trend of environmentally conscious purchasing decisions. Eco-friendly paper frames appeal to consumers looking to reduce their carbon footprint without compromising on aesthetics or quality. This segment has seen significant growth as businesses and individuals alike seek greener alternatives to traditional framing solutions.
