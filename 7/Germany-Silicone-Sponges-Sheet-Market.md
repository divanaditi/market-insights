One major segment is the soft silicone sponge sheets, known for their flexibility and comfort. These sponges are predominantly used in personal care products, such as facial cleaning and scrubbing, where gentle material is a priority. Their ability to effectively retain water and evenly distribute cleaning solutions enhances their appeal. The soft sponges also find applications in medical and healthcare products, especially in wound care, due to their hypoallergenic and non-abrasive nature. Furthermore, this type of sponge sheet is highly favored for use in the automotive industry for cleaning and polishing delicate surfaces.The second prominent segment is the firm silicone sponge sheets, which offer superior durability and resistance to harsh chemicals and high temperatures. These sheets are commonly used in industrial settings, such as manufacturing and electronics, where their robust properties are essential. They are also employed in household cleaning, offering an excellent balance of rigidity and absorbency. Due to their higher resistance to wear and tear, firm silicone sponges are preferred for long-term applications that require consistent performance.
