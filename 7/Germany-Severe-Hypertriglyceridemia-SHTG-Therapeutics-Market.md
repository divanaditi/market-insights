Prescription drugs hold the dominant share in the market, driven by the increasing prevalence of severe hypertriglyceridemia and the need for potent treatments. These prescription therapies typically include fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, statins, and PCSK9 inhibitors, which are administered under medical supervision due to their potent effects on lipid regulation. These medications are often prescribed to reduce triglyceride levels rapidly and manage the associated risk of cardiovascular diseases. With advancements in pharmaceutical research, the availability of novel treatments and combination therapies has further driven the demand for prescription medications. <p>On the other hand, over-the-counter (OTC) medications also contribute to the market but to a lesser extent. OTC treatments often include dietary supplements, such as fish oil or niacin-based products, which are marketed as safer, more accessible alternatives to prescription drugs. Although these therapies are not as effective in managing severe cases of hypertriglyceridemia, they are commonly used for mild to moderate cases or as complementary treatments. The OTC segment has gained traction in the market due to growing consumer awareness and preference for self-management of health conditions. However, as the severity of hypertriglyceridemia increases, the reliance on prescription therapies continues to outweigh the use of OTC options.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/305540/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Severe Hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG) Therapeutics Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Severe Hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG) Therapeutics Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Severe Hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG) Therapeutics Market size was valued at USD 2.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 4.1 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Severe Hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG) Therapeutics Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Ionis Pharmaceuticals</Li><Li> 89bio</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> NorthSea Therapeutics B.V.</Li><Li> Amryt Pharma</Li><Li> Afimmune Pharmaceutical</Li><Li> Zucara Therapeutics</Li><Li> Novo Nordisk</Li><Li> Adocia</Li><Li> Pfizer Inc.</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Severe Hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG) Therapeutics Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Severe Hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG) Therapeutics Market apart.
