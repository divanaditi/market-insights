These software solutions provide automated processes for data collection, analysis, and reporting, which are essential for efficient and accurate lifecycle assessments. Companies can use these tools to model the environmental impacts of their products or services, helping them make data-driven decisions for more sustainable operations. The market for software-based services is expanding rapidly as businesses demand cost-effective and scalable solutions to meet environmental targets. These tools can be used for various industries, such as energy, construction, and chemicals, to optimize resource usage and reduce waste.
