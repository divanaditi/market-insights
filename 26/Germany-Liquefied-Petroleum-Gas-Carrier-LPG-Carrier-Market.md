The most common types include fully pressurized LPG carriers, semi-refrigerated LPG carriers, and fully refrigerated LPG carriers. Fully pressurized LPG carriers are designed to transport LPG at ambient temperatures and relatively lower pressures. They are generally smaller in size and more cost-effective for short-haul deliveries. Semi-refrigerated LPG carriers, on the other hand, can transport LPG at slightly lower temperatures and higher pressures, offering flexibility in terms of cargo capacity and range. Fully refrigerated LPG carriers are the largest type and are designed to transport large volumes of LPG at much lower temperatures and higher pressures. These vessels are ideal for long-haul transportation, offering enhanced storage capacity and efficiency for high-demand routes.<p>Among the different types of LPG carriers, the demand for fully refrigerated LPG carriers has been increasing, driven by the need for larger transport capacities and long-distance routes. These carriers are better suited for larger shipments of LPG from production facilities to distant markets, which is a key factor in the evolving dynamics of the German LPG market. Semi-refrigerated vessels are also gaining traction, as they offer a balance between cost efficiency and storage capacity, making them ideal for regional transportation. The market for fully pressurized carriers remains steady, particularly for domestic and short-haul deliveries, where smaller volumes are required. Each type of carrier serves distinct segments of the LPG supply chain, offering varied solutions for transportation, handling, and storage needs across the region.
