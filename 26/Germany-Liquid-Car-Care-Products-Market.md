These products are designed to remove dirt, grime, and road salt, offering convenience and efficiency. Wax-based products are also in high demand, particularly for their ability to provide a glossy finish while protecting the car’s paint from environmental contaminants. Tire cleaners, which focus on removing dirt and enhancing the appearance of tires, are gaining traction as car enthusiasts focus more on vehicle aesthetics. Interior cleaners, including fabric and upholstery cleaners, also see significant use due to the growing need for maintaining the car’s interior hygiene and comfort.</p><p>Another key category in the Germany liquid car care products market is the range of products designed for vehicle protection, such as polishers and protectants.
