Among the most common types, poultry protein, such as chicken and turkey, is widely preferred due to its high digestibility and nutritional profile. Poultry-based proteins are rich in essential amino acids and are often used in both dry and wet pet foods, catering to a broad range of pet diets. This type of protein also appeals to pet owners seeking high-quality, low-fat options for their pets. Poultry-based proteins are often sourced from local farms, ensuring quality control and sustainability in the supply chain, which further contributes to their popularity in Germany's pet food market.<p>Another significant protein source is beef, which remains a staple in the animal-based protein segment. Beef is favored for its rich flavor and high protein content, providing pets with the necessary nutrients for muscle growth and overall health. Additionally, fish protein, particularly from salmon and other marine sources, is increasingly being included in premium pet food products due to its high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, which support skin health and coat condition. These animal-based proteins cater to the growing trend of natural and holistic pet food formulations, where pet owners are looking for superior protein sources to ensure the health and well-being of their animals.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/840466/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Animal-based Pet Protein Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Animal-based Pet Protein Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Animal-based Pet Protein Market size was valued at USD 4.95 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 8.25 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.2% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Animal-based Pet Protein Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Mars Petcare</Li><Li> Nestle Purina Pet Care</Li><Li> Hill's Pet Nutrition</Li><Li> The J.M.
