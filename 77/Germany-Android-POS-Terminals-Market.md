These terminals are compact, lightweight, and designed to provide payment solutions on the go, making them ideal for small businesses, food trucks, and service-based industries. Mobile POS systems are equipped with wireless capabilities such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular data, allowing for quick and secure payments in remote or mobile settings.
