The most common type is the wall-mounted medical instrument cabinet, which is highly preferred for its space-saving design and easy accessibility. These cabinets are typically installed on walls in hospitals, clinics, and medical laboratories, allowing for efficient organization and quick retrieval of instruments. Wall-mounted cabinets are available in various configurations, offering adjustable shelves, locking mechanisms, and ventilation features to accommodate different types of medical instruments. The demand for wall-mounted cabinets is increasing due to the growing need for compact storage solutions that ensure hygiene and quick access to medical tools.</p><p>Another significant segment is the free-standing medical instrument cabinets, which provide more flexibility in terms of storage and mobility. These cabinets are typically used in areas where wall space is limited or in specialized medical environments that require easily movable storage solutions. Free-standing cabinets offer larger storage capacities, with multiple drawers and compartments to hold a wide variety of instruments. They are designed for durability and are often made from materials that provide resistance to corrosion and easy cleaning.
