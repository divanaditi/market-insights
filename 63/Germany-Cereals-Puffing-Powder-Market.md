Extruded puffing powders are made using an extrusion process that involves high pressure and temperature to expand the starch in the cereal. This method produces a more uniform puff and is widely used in the production of ready-to-eat breakfast cereals and snack foods. The demand for extruded puffing powders has been increasing due to their ability to enhance texture, increase volume, and provide a desirable crunch in cereal products. The growing trend of healthier and innovative cereal products has further driven the need for extruded puffing powders in the market, making it a dominant segment in Germany's cereals industry.</p><p>On the other hand, non-extruded puffing powders are produced through other methods such as steam puffing, dry puffing, or microwave puffing. These methods retain more of the natural flavors and nutrients of the raw cereals, making non-extruded puffing powders popular among health-conscious consumers. Although this segment holds a smaller share compared to the extruded type, it is growing steadily as consumer preferences shift towards organic and minimally processed foods. The rising demand for gluten-free, natural, and high-protein cereals has contributed to the expansion of non-extruded puffing powders. These factors are expected to drive continued growth in the segment, offering a competitive alternative to extruded puffing powders in Germany’s cereals market.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/733106/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Cereals Puffing Powder Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Cereals Puffing Powder Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Cereals Puffing Powder Market size was valued at USD 1.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.5 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.1% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Cereals Puffing Powder Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Lesaffre</Li><Li> AB Mauri</Li><Li> Lallemand</Li><Li> ANGEL</Li><Li> FORISE YEAST</Li><Li> SUNKEEN</Li><Li> Vitality King</Li><Li> Kraft</Li><Li> Church & Dwight</Li><Li> Solvay</Li><Li> Natural Soda</Li><Li> Berun</Li><Li> Yuhua Chemical</Li><Li> Haohua Honghe</Li><Li> Hailian Sanyi</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Cereals Puffing Powder Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Cereals Puffing Powder Market apart.
