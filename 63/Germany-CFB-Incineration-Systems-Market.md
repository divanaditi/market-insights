Traditional CFB systems have long been favored for their ability to handle a wide range of waste materials with consistent performance. These systems utilize a fluidized bed of particles to maintain combustion efficiency, allowing them to process municipal solid waste (MSW), industrial waste, and biomass. Their ability to operate at high temperatures ensures efficient burning of waste with minimal emissions, making them a preferred choice for many waste-to-energy applications across Germany. With a focus on reducing operational costs and improving waste treatment, traditional systems continue to play a key role in the waste management industry.</p><p>On the other hand, advanced CFB incineration systems are designed to offer enhanced operational flexibility, lower emissions, and higher efficiency levels.
