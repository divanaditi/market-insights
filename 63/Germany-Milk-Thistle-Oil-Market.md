One of the primary segments includes conventional milk thistle oil, which is derived using traditional extraction methods such as cold-pressing. This type of oil is widely popular due to its natural properties and effectiveness in promoting liver health and detoxification. Conventional oil holds a significant market share as it is considered a more organic option, appealing to health-conscious consumers. It is also used in cosmetics and skincare products due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a preferred choice in the personal care industry. With increasing awareness regarding natural remedies and organic products, the demand for conventional milk thistle oil continues to rise across various sectors in Germany.<p>On the other hand, another notable segment is organic milk thistle oil, which is produced from milk thistle plants grown without the use of synthetic pesticides or fertilizers. Organic milk thistle oil has gained traction in the market due to the rising trend of organic and sustainably sourced products among German consumers. It is seen as a premium product due to its higher quality and the meticulous processes involved in its production. The demand for organic oil is also driven by growing consumer interest in cleaner, environmentally friendly products that contribute to overall well-being.
