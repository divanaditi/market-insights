Shelving units, bookcases, and storage bins are the most common products, offering versatile solutions for organizing toys, books, and clothing. These types of furniture are popular due to their ability to maximize space and maintain order in children’s rooms. Additionally, modular storage systems have gained traction, allowing parents to adjust the configurations as their children's needs change over time. Storage benches and multi-purpose furniture, such as beds with built-in drawers, are also increasingly sought after for their space-saving benefits and dual functionality.<p>Another important segment in the market includes closet systems and wardrobe solutions.
