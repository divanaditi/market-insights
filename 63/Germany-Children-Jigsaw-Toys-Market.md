Wooden jigsaw puzzles are highly popular due to their durability and eco-friendly nature, making them a favored choice among parents and educators. These puzzles often feature educational themes, aiding in the development of cognitive and motor skills for children. They are available in a variety of designs, including alphabet, animal, and number puzzles, which provide both entertainment and learning opportunities. The longevity and sturdiness of wooden puzzles also make them ideal for repeated use, contributing to their strong presence in the market.</p><p>Cardboard jigsaw puzzles, on the other hand, are more affordable and widely accessible, contributing to their growing demand in the German market. These puzzles come in a wide range of sizes and themes, including popular children's cartoons, vehicles, and landscapes. With vivid colors and lightweight materials, they are perfect for younger children. The ease of handling and affordable price point of cardboard puzzles make them a frequent choice for families looking for a fun, engaging, and cost-effective activity for their children.
