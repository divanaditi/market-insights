One of the most popular types is the savory mixed congee, which incorporates a blend of meats, seafood, vegetables, and seasonings. These varieties offer rich flavors and are often considered a meal in themselves due to their filling nature. Savory congees appeal to a wide consumer base, from those seeking nutritious, hearty meals to those interested in traditional comfort foods. The savory congee type is often made with rice as a base, allowing for a variety of flavors that can cater to diverse dietary preferences and regional tastes.</p><p>On the other hand, sweet mixed congee types have also gained traction in the German market, especially among those who enjoy lighter, sweeter options for breakfast or dessert. Sweet congee typically includes ingredients like fruits, sugar, and sometimes nuts or seeds, offering a delicate balance between sweetness and texture. This type is more commonly consumed as a snack or a light meal, and its popularity continues to grow as consumer preferences shift towards healthier, yet indulgent, alternatives.
