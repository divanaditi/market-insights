The demand for wellness apps is growing as consumers increasingly seek self-monitoring tools that help them improve their lifestyle choices. Many of these apps are connected with wearable devices like fitness trackers, further enhancing their effectiveness. This category of mHealth services is expected to continue expanding due to the rising health-consciousness among the German population and the increasing adoption of mobile technology in daily life.</p><p>Another major segment within the mHealth services market in Germany is the telemedicine and remote patient monitoring services.
