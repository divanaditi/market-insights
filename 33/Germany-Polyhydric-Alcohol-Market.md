Glycerol dominates the market due to its extensive application in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries. It is widely used as a humectant, solvent, and thickening agent in various products. Additionally, glycerol is utilized in the production of antifreeze, and in industrial applications such as plasticizers and emulsifiers. The rising demand for glycerol is linked to the growth of the cosmetics and personal care sector, where it is used in skin care products for its moisturizing properties. Furthermore, glycerol’s role in bio-based chemicals and sustainable manufacturing practices further supports its market dominance in Germany.</p><p>Sorbitol is another significant polyhydric alcohol in the German market, commonly found in the food and beverage sector as a sugar substitute.
