Major appliances include larger, more expensive products such as refrigerators, washing machines, ovens, and dishwashers. These products are typically considered essential for daily living and are often purchased infrequently. They are largely influenced by factors like technological advancements, energy efficiency, and consumer preferences for smart home integration. With the rise of sustainability trends, German consumers are increasingly opting for energy-efficient and eco-friendly major appliances, boosting their demand. Retailers offering these items are focusing on providing personalized customer service, offering extended warranties, and promoting installation services to enhance customer experience and increase sales.Small appliances, on the other hand, include items such as coffee makers, toasters, microwaves, and vacuum cleaners. These appliances are more affordable and are often purchased more frequently than major appliances. Consumers in Germany increasingly value the convenience and functionality that small appliances provide, as they make everyday tasks more efficient. The demand for smart, connected small appliances is also on the rise, as technology continues to advance. Retailers are responding by offering a wide range of products that cater to different consumer needs, from budget-friendly options to high-end, feature-rich models.
