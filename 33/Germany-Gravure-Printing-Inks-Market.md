Solvent-based inks are widely used in gravure printing due to their quick drying time and excellent adhesion to various substrates. These inks are particularly effective in applications such as packaging, labels, and flexible films. Solvent-based gravure inks provide vibrant color reproduction and are ideal for high-quality printing on a variety of materials. They also offer durability and resistance to environmental factors, making them suitable for outdoor use. The growing demand for flexible packaging and high-quality printing jobs has contributed to the continued preference for solvent-based inks in the country.</p><p>Water-based gravure printing inks, on the other hand, have gained popularity due to their environmentally friendly nature. These inks contain water as a primary solvent, making them less harmful to the environment compared to their solvent-based counterparts. The increasing emphasis on sustainability and regulations surrounding volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have fueled the adoption of water-based inks in Germany’s gravure printing industry. These inks offer excellent print quality and are widely used in food packaging, labels, and corrugated cartons. The market for water-based gravure printing inks is expected to grow steadily as industries focus on reducing their carbon footprint and complying with stringent environmental standards.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/503256/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Gravure Printing Inks Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Gravure Printing Inks Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Gravure Printing Inks Market size was valued at USD 5.12 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 7.45 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.2% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Gravure Printing Inks Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Tokyo Printing Ink</Li><Li> Dainichiseika Color & Chemicals</Li><Li> Sun Chemical</Li><Li> Flint Group</Li><Li> Toyo Ink SC Holdings</Li><Li> Lawter</Li><Li> Yansefu Inks and Coatings</Li><Li> Siegwerk</Li><Li> Sakata INX</Li><Li> Huber Group</Li><Li> Zeller&Gmelin</Li><Li> ALTANA</Li><Li> Wikoff Color</Li><Li> SICPA Holding</Li><Li> Fujifilm Sericol</Li><Li> Royal Dutch Printing Ink Factories Van Son</Li><Li> T&K TOKA</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Gravure Printing Inks Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Gravure Printing Inks Market apart.
