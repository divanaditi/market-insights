Manual steering columns have been traditionally used in vehicles, featuring a mechanical design that requires the driver to manually adjust the steering position. However, the growing trend of vehicle customization and demand for comfort has driven the shift towards electric modular steering columns. These columns use electric motors to allow for easy adjustment, offering enhanced flexibility in steering wheel positioning. As consumers seek advanced features, the electric segment is seeing significant growth, driven by technological advancements in automotive systems.</p><p>Electric modular steering columns offer improved functionality with features like power tilt and telescopic adjustments, providing users with a more personalized driving experience. This segment is expected to dominate the market due to rising consumer preferences for convenience and high-end vehicle specifications. Additionally, electric modular systems can integrate seamlessly with modern vehicle electronics, aligning with the broader trend of electrification in the automotive industry. As the demand for these advanced systems continues to rise, electric modular steering columns are likely to remain the ultimate choice for new vehicle designs in Germany.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/414164/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Modular Steering Column Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Modular Steering Column Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Modular Steering Column Market size was valued at USD 2.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 4.5 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 8.3% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Modular Steering Column Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Thyssenkrupp AG</Li><Li> ZF</Li><Li> Leopold Kostal Gmbh & Co.
