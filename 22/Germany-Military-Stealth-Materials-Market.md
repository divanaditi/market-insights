RAM is extensively used in military applications to reduce the radar cross-section (RCS) of aircraft, naval vessels, and land-based vehicles. These materials are designed to absorb radar waves and minimize the reflection of electromagnetic signals, which helps in avoiding detection by enemy radar systems. Various types of RAM, including conductive, magnetic, and carbon-based composites, are being developed for specialized stealth applications. With the increasing focus on enhancing stealth capabilities, the demand for advanced RAM is expected to grow significantly in Germany's military sector, particularly for next-generation aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).<p>Another prominent type in the market is the stealth coatings, which are applied to military platforms to further reduce their visibility to both radar and infrared sensors. Stealth coatings include both radar-absorbing paints and specialized materials that manage heat signatures. These coatings play a vital role in optimizing the overall stealth characteristics of defense equipment, including submarines, fighter jets, and tanks. In addition to offering improved radar evasion, they also help in lowering thermal detection, providing an added layer of operational security.
