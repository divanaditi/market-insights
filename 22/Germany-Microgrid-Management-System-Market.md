Grid-connected microgrids are systems that can operate in conjunction with the main power grid. These systems offer high reliability and efficiency by allowing energy to flow between the microgrid and the central grid. They are commonly used in urban areas and industrial applications, where the flexibility to supply or receive power from the larger grid is essential. The increasing integration of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, has further spurred the adoption of grid-connected microgrids, as these systems can balance energy demand and supply fluctuations in real time. Moreover, advancements in communication technologies and energy storage are making grid-connected microgrids more efficient and sustainable, driving their growth in the German market.<p>On the other hand, off-grid microgrids are designed to operate independently of the central grid, providing power to remote or isolated locations. These systems are often deployed in rural areas, islands, and regions with unreliable grid access. Off-grid microgrids are particularly beneficial for enhancing energy security, reducing dependency on traditional energy sources, and promoting the use of renewable energy. In Germany, the demand for off-grid microgrids is being driven by the need for sustainable solutions in areas with poor infrastructure or no access to the main grid.
