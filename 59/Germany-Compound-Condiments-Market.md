It has a growing presence in both traditional and modern recipes, with different varieties such as Dijon and yellow mustard catering to diverse consumer preferences. Ketchup, a classic accompaniment to fries and other fast food items, continues to maintain a strong position in the market due to its popularity among all age groups and its continuous innovation in flavors and packaging formats.</p><p>In addition to these, sauces like barbecue sauce, hot sauce, and other specialty condiments are also significant contributors to the compound condiments market in Germany.
