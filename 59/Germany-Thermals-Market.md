Innerwear thermals are designed for everyday use and are made from materials such as wool, cotton, and synthetic fibers to offer comfort and insulation. These thermals are ideal for consumers seeking warmth without compromising on style or comfort. Sportswear thermals, on the other hand, are engineered for high-performance and are typically made from moisture-wicking materials. They are highly popular among outdoor enthusiasts and athletes as they help maintain body temperature while providing ease of movement during physical activities. The demand for such products is fueled by the increasing participation in sports and fitness activities, along with the rising popularity of outdoor adventures in Germany.</p><p>Outdoor thermals represent another key segment in the market, designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions while providing insulation and comfort in extreme weather. These thermals are often used by individuals engaging in outdoor activities such as hiking, skiing, or mountaineering. The growing interest in adventure tourism and winter sports in Germany has contributed to the increased demand for high-quality outdoor thermals. They are typically made from advanced materials like fleece, merino wool, and thermal blends, which offer superior warmth without adding excessive weight. This segment also benefits from the trend of consumers seeking high-tech, functional clothing to improve their outdoor experiences.
