Console gaming continues to be a major part of the market, with popular gaming consoles such as PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch leading the demand.

The convenience, ease of use, and high-quality graphics offered by modern consoles contribute significantly to the popularity of this gaming type. As a result, the console segment maintains a steady growth trajectory, supported by advancements in hardware and the expansion of online gaming platforms like PlayStation Network and Xbox Live, which further enhance the overall gaming experience.<p>On the other hand, PC gaming in Germany has seen a continued rise in popularity due to its flexibility, powerful hardware capabilities, and access to a wide variety of games. The PC segment is characterized by a diverse gaming ecosystem, where both casual gamers and eSports enthusiasts engage in different genres, ranging from strategy games to fast-paced shooters. The ability to customize gaming setups, access to mods, and the wide array of online multiplayer experiences have solidified PC gaming as a dominant force in the market.
