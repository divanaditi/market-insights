The most common types include polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and nylon. Polyethylene turf is highly favored for its softness and natural look, making it ideal for recreational areas like playgrounds, residential lawns, and sports fields. It offers a more comfortable feel underfoot, which is a key consideration for leisure spaces. Polypropylene, on the other hand, is a more cost-effective option, frequently used for decorative purposes or low-traffic areas. Its durability is less than that of polyethylene but still suitable for specific leisure applications. Nylon turf is the most durable but also the most expensive, making it suitable for areas with high traffic where longevity is a priority, such as public parks or sports complexes that experience frequent use.</p><p>Another important distinction in the market is the pile height and density, which are factors influenced by the type of turf selected.

Synthetic grass with higher pile density provides a more realistic and lush appearance, enhancing the leisure experience for users.
