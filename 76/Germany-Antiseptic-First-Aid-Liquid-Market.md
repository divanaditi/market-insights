Alcohol-based solutions, such as those containing isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, are widely used in homes, hospitals, and clinics for disinfecting wounds and preventing infections. These products are highly sought after because of their fast-acting properties and ease of use. Furthermore, they have broad applications in first aid kits, medical facilities, and for personal hygiene, making them a preferred choice for individuals looking for quick antiseptic solutions.<p>Another important segment in the German antiseptic first aid liquid market is the iodine-based antiseptic liquids.
