One of the prominent types includes nucleoside/nucleotide analogs, which are used primarily to treat chronic viral infections like hepatitis B and C. These therapies work by interfering with the replication of viral DNA or RNA, thereby preventing the virus from multiplying and reducing the severity of the infection. Another significant category includes protease inhibitors, which target viral enzymes responsible for viral replication. These inhibitors are especially effective in the treatment of HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C. The adoption of these antiviral drugs has seen a steady rise due to their high efficacy and the increasing prevalence of viral diseases in the country, with ongoing advancements improving both their accessibility and effectiveness.<p>The market also includes non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), which are commonly used in combination with other antiviral agents for treating HIV. These agents help inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, which is crucial for HIV replication, ultimately leading to reduced viral load and better immune system function. Additionally, immune modulators, including interferons, are used in the treatment of various viral infections such as hepatitis B, C, and some types of cancers. These therapies enhance the body's immune response to combat the virus more effectively. As Germany continues to invest in healthcare infrastructure and research, the market for antiviral therapies is expected to expand, driven by the growing demand for targeted treatments and the increasing awareness of viral diseases.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/832058/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Antiviral Therapy Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Antiviral Therapy Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Antiviral Therapy Market size was valued at USD 50 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 80 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Antiviral Therapy Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>AbbVie Inc.</Li><Li> Abbott</Li><Li> F.
