Oral Apixaban, in the form of tablets, holds the largest market share, as it is widely used for the treatment of conditions such as atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. The convenience and ease of use associated with oral administration make it the preferred choice for patients and healthcare providers. This segment continues to experience strong growth due to increasing incidences of cardiovascular diseases, along with the demand for convenient, self-administered anticoagulants that do not require regular monitoring of blood clotting parameters.<p>On the other hand, the injectable form of Apixaban is gaining traction, especially for hospital settings or for patients who are unable to take oral medication. This injectable formulation is designed for rapid onset of action and is often used in acute settings such as surgery or in patients with impaired gastrointestinal absorption. The demand for injectable Apixaban is gradually increasing, driven by advances in formulation technologies and the rising need for more effective, fast-acting anticoagulants in clinical practice. Both segments are expected to grow as the adoption of Apixaban continues to rise in Germany’s healthcare landscape, supported by regulatory approvals and growing awareness about its benefits over traditional anticoagulants.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/831354/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Apixaban API Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Apixaban API Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Apixaban API Market size was valued at USD 1.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.8 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 8.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Apixaban API Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Neuraxpharm / INKE</Li><Li> Basic Pharma Life Science Pvt Ltd</Li><Li> Teva</Li><Li> Tianyu Pharm</Li><Li> Element Chemilink Pvt Ltd</Li><Li> Jinan Jianfeng Chemical Co.</Li><Li>Ltd.</Li><Li> CTX Life Sciences</Li><Li> Mehta API Pvt Ltd</Li><Li> Hisun</Li><Li> Amtec Health Care Pvt.
