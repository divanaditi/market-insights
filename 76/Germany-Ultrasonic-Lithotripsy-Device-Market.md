Portable devices are gaining significant traction due to their compact size, ease of use, and versatility in various medical settings. These devices are highly preferred in outpatient clinics and smaller healthcare facilities due to their cost-effectiveness and mobility. Their ability to deliver high-frequency sound waves to break down kidney stones makes them particularly advantageous for procedures requiring mobility and reduced patient downtime. As the demand for non-invasive treatments rises, portable devices are becoming a key component in the management of renal stones in patients with limited access to large hospital facilities.<p>On the other hand, stationary ultrasonic lithotripsy devices dominate large hospitals and specialized clinics due to their advanced technology and high-power output. These devices are capable of delivering more precise and intense ultrasonic waves, making them suitable for treating larger or more complex kidney stones. Stationary devices are designed for high throughput and reliability, often integrated with sophisticated imaging systems that allow for real-time stone visualization. Although they require fixed installations and more substantial capital investment, their efficiency and the ability to perform multiple procedures per day make them indispensable in high-volume medical environments.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/831016/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Ultrasonic Lithotripsy Device Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Ultrasonic Lithotripsy Device Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Ultrasonic Lithotripsy Device Market size was valued at USD 0.75 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 1.25 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.0% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Ultrasonic Lithotripsy Device Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Boston Scientific</Li><Li> Olympus</Li><Li> Siemens Medical Solutions</Li><Li> DirexGroup</Li><Li> Storz Medical</Li><Li> Dornier MedTech</Li><Li> Allengers Medical Systems</Li><Li> New Star Lasers</Li><Li> Bard Medical Division</Li><Li> Coloplast Group</Li><Li> Cook Medical</Li><Li> EDAP TMS</Li><Li> E.M.S.
