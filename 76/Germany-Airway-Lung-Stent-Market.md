Metallic stents are the most commonly used in clinical practice due to their durability, flexibility, and ability to provide strong support to the airway passages. These stents are typically made from materials such as stainless steel or nitinol, which offer excellent resistance to compression and are designed to maintain the airway's patency for a longer period. Metallic stents are often used in patients with severe airway obstructions caused by conditions like lung cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The demand for metallic stents in Germany is expected to grow as the aging population increases and more individuals are diagnosed with respiratory diseases that require airway intervention.<p>Non-metallic stents, on the other hand, are gaining popularity in the German market due to their ability to reduce complications associated with metallic stents. These stents are usually made from biocompatible polymers or silicone, offering a softer alternative that minimizes irritation and trauma to the airway walls. Non-metallic stents are preferred in cases where the patient's condition requires less invasive treatment and for patients with a history of allergic reactions to metals. These stents also tend to be more flexible and conform to the shape of the airway, which can improve patient comfort. As the demand for minimally invasive procedures increases, the non-metallic segment of the airway lung stent market in Germany is likely to see substantial growth in the coming years, driven by advancements in materials and growing awareness of patient safety.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/838652/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Airway Lung Stent Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Airway Lung Stent Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Airway Lung Stent Market size was valued at USD 0.78 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 1.20 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.8% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Airway Lung Stent Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Zeus Industrial Products</Li><Li> W.
