The two most common types are cold-rolled and hot-rolled nickel-plated steel. Cold-rolled steel, with its smooth and fine finish, is typically preferred for applications requiring higher precision and enhanced strength-to-weight ratio. This type of steel is used extensively in battery components, such as terminals and connectors, where durability and corrosion resistance are essential. The cold-rolling process ensures that the nickel plating adheres strongly to the steel, providing a uniform and reliable conductive surface, crucial for the efficiency of lithium-ion batteries. The demand for cold-rolled nickel-plated steel is growing, driven by its ability to meet the high-performance standards required for modern battery technologies.<p>On the other hand, hot-rolled nickel-plated steel offers a more cost-effective solution for large-scale battery manufacturing. This type of steel, while not as refined as cold-rolled steel, provides excellent mechanical properties and is suitable for bulk production of lithium-ion batteries. Hot-rolled steel undergoes a heating process before rolling, making it less prone to cracking or defects during the manufacturing process. Its relatively lower cost, combined with its strength and resistance to corrosion, makes it a popular choice for less critical battery components.
