Low acrylonitrile NBR, which contains less than 30% acrylonitrile, is highly resistant to fuel, oils, and acids, making it ideal for automotive applications, such as seals, gaskets, and hoses. This type of NBR is also favored in the manufacturing of gloves, footwear, and industrial applications where chemical resistance is crucial. Low acrylonitrile NBR is particularly popular in the automotive and healthcare industries, owing to its versatility and robust performance in demanding environments. The demand for this type of NBR is driven by the continued expansion of the automotive sector and stringent regulations requiring high-performance materials that offer enhanced resistance to various chemicals and extreme conditions.</p><p>High acrylonitrile NBR, containing over 30% acrylonitrile, exhibits superior resistance to oil, fuels, and solvent-based chemicals. This type is particularly sought after in industries where high oil resistance is essential, such as in oil and gas, machinery, and heavy-duty industrial applications. High acrylonitrile NBR is commonly used in products like fuel hoses, O-rings, and gaskets that are exposed to harsh chemical environments. The increasing demand for high-performance materials in industrial and manufacturing sectors has contributed to the growth of high acrylonitrile NBR. Furthermore, the rising need for more durable and long-lasting rubber products in high-risk environments is boosting the adoption of this type, which offers enhanced strength, chemical resistance, and durability, making it ideal for high-stress applications.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/398676/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR) Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR) Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR) Market size was valued at USD 5.0 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 8.0 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR) Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Lanxess</Li><Li> CNPC</Li><Li> Ningbo Shunze</Li><Li> Nantex</Li><Li> Kumho Petrochemical</Li><Li> JSR Corporation</Li><Li> LG Chem</Li><Li> Versalis S.P.A</Li><Li> Zeon Corporation</Li><Li> Sibur Holding</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR) Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR) Market apart.
