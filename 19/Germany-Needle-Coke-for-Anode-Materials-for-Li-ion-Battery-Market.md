Petroleum-based needle coke dominates the market due to its superior quality, with a high level of crystallinity and low impurities, making it ideal for the high-performance anode materials used in Li-ion batteries. This type of needle coke is produced through the process of distilling and refining crude oil, which results in a material with enhanced structural properties, leading to improved battery efficiency and longevity. The increasing demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy storage solutions has driven the preference for petroleum-based needle coke as a key component in high-capacity batteries. As a result, manufacturers in Germany are focusing on optimizing production techniques to meet the growing demand for advanced battery technologies that require high-quality anode materials.</p><p>Coal-based needle coke, while a smaller segment compared to petroleum-based needle coke, is also gaining attention for its cost-effectiveness and availability. This type of needle coke is derived from coking coal, which is heated to high temperatures to produce a carbon-rich material suitable for use in anode applications. Although it may not offer the same level of performance as petroleum-based needle coke, it is still a viable option for less demanding battery applications. The coal-based segment is expected to see moderate growth as manufacturers look for more affordable alternatives to reduce production costs. In Germany, the demand for coal-based needle coke is expected to increase as industrial applications, including energy storage systems and other battery-powered devices, continue to expand.
