Spring-loaded injectors utilize a spring mechanism to deliver the medication under high pressure, offering a quick and precise injection. These devices are widely used for subcutaneous injections and are designed to minimize patient discomfort while ensuring accurate drug delivery. Spring-loaded injectors are particularly popular for vaccines, insulin, and other biologics. Their ability to deliver consistent dosing and reduce needle-related risks such as infections and needle-stick injuries has contributed to their growing adoption among healthcare providers and patients alike. This segment is expected to see significant growth due to the increasing demand for non-invasive drug delivery methods, particularly in chronic disease management and immunization programs.<p>On the other hand, gas-powered injectors utilize compressed gas or air to force the medication through the skin. These injectors are typically used for high-pressure applications where precision and rapid delivery are crucial.
