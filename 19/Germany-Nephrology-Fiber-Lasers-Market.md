Holmium fiber lasers are widely adopted in nephrology due to their precise tissue ablation capabilities, which make them effective for treating kidney stones and other urinary tract issues. These lasers offer excellent flexibility, allowing for both contact and non-contact procedures. They also provide high safety levels due to their ability to minimize collateral damage to surrounding tissues. This segment is expected to continue dominating the market, driven by advancements in technology that enhance their operational efficiency and reliability in various clinical settings.</p><p>In addition to holmium lasers, the market also features erbium and thulium fiber lasers, which are emerging as viable alternatives in nephrology treatments. Erbium fiber lasers are particularly noted for their versatility and precision in soft tissue applications, while thulium lasers are recognized for their high water absorption characteristics, making them effective for procedures in highly vascularized areas. Both these lasers are becoming increasingly popular due to their enhanced safety profiles and effectiveness in performing delicate procedures.
