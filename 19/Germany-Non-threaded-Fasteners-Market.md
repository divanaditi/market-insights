Among the leading types, rivets are highly used in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and construction. Rivets offer strong mechanical fastening solutions, providing high durability and resistance to vibrations and stresses. Another significant category includes pins, which come in various forms such as cotter pins, clevis pins, and taper pins. These are widely adopted for their versatility and ease of installation in numerous machinery and equipment. The demand for these non-threaded fasteners continues to rise, driven by industries seeking reliable, long-lasting, and cost-effective solutions for fastening components in critical applications.<p>Additionally, the market also witnesses significant demand for retaining rings and washers, which play a vital role in securing components and preventing them from slipping or moving. Retaining rings are essential in applications requiring the retention of parts in housings or on shafts. Washers, on the other hand, are used to distribute the load of a fastener and prevent damage to the material being fastened. These types of fasteners are widely used across automotive, construction, and electrical sectors, where efficiency, safety, and quality are prioritized. As technological advancements continue, there is a growing need for specialized non-threaded fasteners to </p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/395698/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Non-threaded Fasteners Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Non-threaded Fasteners Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Non-threaded Fasteners Market size was valued at USD 18.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 27.4 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Non-threaded Fasteners Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Apex Fasteners</Li><Li> Packer Fastener</Li><Li> MNP Corporation</Li><Li> Anixter</Li><Li> Acument Global Technologies</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> Dokka Fasteners As</Li><Li> Hilti Corporation</Li><Li> Mw Industries</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> Rockford Fasteners</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> Slidematic</Li><Li> Eastwood Manufacturing</Li><Li> Brunner Manufacturing Co.
