Cleansing oils dominate the market, as they are highly effective in dissolving makeup and impurities while providing moisturizing benefits. These products are formulated with plant-based oils such as jojoba, almond, and coconut, which are gentle on the skin and suitable for sensitive skin types. Additionally, micellar waters have gained significant popularity due to their ability to remove makeup while maintaining the skin’s natural hydration balance. These water-based cleansers contain micelles that trap and lift makeup, dirt, and oil, leaving the skin refreshed without the need for rinsing. The demand for organic micellar waters in Germany is increasing, driven by consumer preferences for chemical-free and cruelty-free skincare solutions.<p>Other types of organic makeup removers in the German market include cleansing balms and wipes, which offer convenience and efficient cleansing on-the-go. Cleansing balms are typically formulated with organic butter and oils, ensuring nourishment and moisture after makeup removal, making them ideal for dry or mature skin. They are often preferred by consumers who seek an all-in-one skincare solution with a rich texture. Organic makeup remover wipes, on the other hand, are becoming a popular choice for their portability and ease of use. They are infused with natural ingredients like aloe vera and chamomile, which are known for their soothing properties, making them a good option for sensitive skin.
