Insulated jackets are particularly popular during the colder months, providing warmth through materials like down or synthetic insulation.

Softshell jackets are designed for versatility and lightweight performance, often favored for moderate weather conditions or as mid-layers during high-intensity activities, such as climbing or trekking.</p><p>The growing trend towards multifunctional outdoor jackets has seen a rise in hybrid models that combine the best features of insulated, waterproof, and softshell jackets. As outdoor recreation continues to grow in popularity, the demand for jackets that cater to specific weather conditions and activities is expected to increase. The Germany market sees a variety of choices across these segments, where manufacturers focus on combining functionality, durability, and design. The variety in jacket types caters to consumers with varying preferences and needs, from those focused on warmth and insulation to those seeking lightweight and breathable options. Additionally, there has been a rising demand for eco-friendly and sustainable outdoor apparel, influencing the design and material choices in the jacket segments.
