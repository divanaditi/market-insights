Traditional metal braces are one of the most commonly used products, owing to their effectiveness and relatively lower cost. These braces consist of metal brackets and wires that gradually align the teeth. Ceramic braces, a more aesthetic alternative, are also gaining popularity, as they blend with the color of the teeth and are less noticeable than metal braces. Additionally, self-ligating braces, which do not require elastic ties to hold the wire in place, are becoming increasingly common due to their reduced treatment time and improved comfort. The demand for these products is driven by advancements in orthodontic technology, as well as growing awareness about dental aesthetics and oral health in Germany. <p>Aligners represent another significant segment in the German orthodontic treatment market, with clear aligners being a preferred choice among adults and teenagers seeking a discreet and comfortable solution. Clear aligners are removable, making them more convenient for daily activities like eating and brushing.

The increasing popularity of clear aligners in Germany is also attributed to their comfort, ease of use, and the growing trend of adults seeking orthodontic treatments. Innovations in 3D printing and scanning technologies have further enhanced the precision and efficiency of aligners, contributing to their growth in the market.
