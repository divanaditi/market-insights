Pharmaceuticals include antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiparasitics, and other treatments aimed at alleviating common health issues in animals. Antibiotics are widely used to treat infections in pets and livestock, while anti-inflammatory drugs help manage pain and inflammation. Antiparasitics are essential for preventing or treating external and internal parasites, which are common in animals. These pharmaceutical products are readily available over-the-counter, providing pet owners and farmers with accessible options for maintaining animal health without a prescription.</p><p>On the other hand, biologics consist of vaccines, immune boosters, and other biological products designed to prevent diseases and enhance the immune response in animals. Vaccines are crucial in protecting animals from various infectious diseases, while immune boosters help strengthen the animal’s natural defenses. The increasing awareness about preventive care and disease control has contributed to the growth of biologics in the OTC veterinary drug market. Together, pharmaceuticals and biologics dominate the market, providing a diverse range of treatments to improve animal well-being in Germany.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/382890/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany OTC Veterinary Drug Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany OTC Veterinary Drug Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>OTC Veterinary Drug Market size was valued at USD 8.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 12.3 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.4% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany OTC Veterinary Drug Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Zoetis</Li><Li> Boehringer Ingelheim</Li><Li> Virbac S.A.</Li><Li> Hester Biosciences Ltd.</Li><Li> Merck Animal Health</Li><Li> Elanco Animal Health</Li><Li> Ceva SantÃ© Animale</Li><Li> Vetoquinol S.A.</Li><Li> Phibro Animal Health Corporation</Li><Li> Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany OTC Veterinary Drug Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany OTC Veterinary Drug Market apart.
