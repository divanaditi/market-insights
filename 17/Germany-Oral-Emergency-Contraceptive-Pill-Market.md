Levonorgestrel-based pills, such as Plan B and Take Action, are the most commonly used form of emergency contraception. These pills are designed to prevent pregnancy when taken within 72 hours after unprotected sex, though their effectiveness is higher the sooner they are taken. Levonorgestrel works by inhibiting or delaying ovulation, preventing fertilization or implantation of a fertilized egg. The widespread availability and affordability of these pills make them a popular choice among women in Germany. Due to their simple mode of action and effectiveness, Levonorgestrel-based pills dominate the market, holding the largest market share in the country.<p>Ulipristal Acetate-based pills, such asellaOne, offer an alternative for emergency contraception and are available in Germany as well. Unlike Levonorgestrel, Ulipristal Acetate works by blocking the action of progesterone, which is necessary for ovulation. This type of pill can be taken up to 120 hours after unprotected sex, providing a broader window of effectiveness compared to Levonorgestrel-based pills. Though slightly more expensive, Ulipristal Acetate pills are seen as a more effective option in certain cases, especially when taken after the 72-hour window of Levonorgestrel pills. The availability of both types of oral emergency contraceptive pills in Germany ensures that women have access to a range of options for preventing unintended pregnancies, catering to various needs and preferences across the population.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/385618/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Oral Emergency Contraceptive Pill Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Oral Emergency Contraceptive Pill Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Oral Emergency Contraceptive Pill Market size was valued at USD 1.3 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 1.9 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.2% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Oral Emergency Contraceptive Pill Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Mylan Nv</Li><Li> Ansell Limited</Li><Li> Bayer AG</Li><Li> Church & Dwight Co.</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> Merck & Co.</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> Pfizer Inc.</Li><Li> Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited</Li><Li> The Cooper Companies</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> The Female Health Company</Li><Li> Abviee Inc</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Oral Emergency Contraceptive Pill Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Oral Emergency Contraceptive Pill Market apart.
