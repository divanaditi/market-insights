Additionally, felt for prosthetics is another important segment in the market, providing crucial cushioning and support for artificial limbs. These felts are used to enhance the fit and comfort of prosthetic devices, ensuring better mobility for individuals who have undergone amputations. The increasing demand for personalized and comfortable solutions for orthopedic needs is expected to drive growth in these segments.</p><p>Another significant segment in the orthopedic felt market in Germany is felt for orthopedic supports and braces.
