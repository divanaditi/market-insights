Steel cords dominate the market due to their superior strength, durability, and resistance to abrasion. These steel cords are integral in enhancing the performance of off-the-road (OTR) tires, making them suitable for heavy-duty vehicles that operate in harsh and rugged environments. Steel-cord tires are often chosen for their ability to withstand the extreme stress and weight that OTR vehicles encounter, ensuring longer service life and better operational efficiency. The demand for steel-cord reinforced OTR tires has been growing, driven by the expansion of infrastructure projects and the rise in mining activities in Germany, which require robust tire solutions for trucks and heavy machinery.<p>In addition to steel cords, synthetic cords, such as polyester and nylon, are gaining traction in the Germany OTR tire cords market. These materials offer improved flexibility, lighter weight, and lower costs compared to steel cords, while still maintaining satisfactory performance for certain types of OTR vehicles. Synthetic tire cords are often used in applications that do not require the extreme strength of steel but still require reliable durability for regular off-road operations. The shift toward synthetic materials is also supported by the growing emphasis on fuel efficiency and environmental concerns, as these cords contribute to reducing the overall weight of the tires, which can lead to lower fuel consumption. As manufacturers explore cost-effective and efficient tire solutions, the demand for synthetic OTR tire cords is expected to continue rising in the market.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/382812/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany OTR Tire Cords Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany OTR Tire Cords Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>OTR Tire Cords Market size was valued at USD 1.45 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.15 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.4% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany OTR Tire Cords Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Bekaert</Li><Li> Jiangsu Xingda Steel Cord</Li><Li> Kiswire</Li><Li> Hyosung</Li><Li> Shandong SNTON Steel Cord</Li><Li> Bridgestone</Li><Li> Shougang Century</Li><Li> Tokusen</Li><Li> Tokyo Rope MFG</Li><Li> Hubei Fuxing New Material</Li><Li> BMZ</Li><Li> Henan Hengxing</Li><Li> Junma Tyre Cord</Li><Li> Sumitomo Electric Industries</Li><Li> Sodetal</Li><Li> Kordsa Global</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany OTR Tire Cords Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany OTR Tire Cords Market apart.
