Diagnostic testing is commonly used for individuals who display symptoms of a genetic disorder or have a family history of genetic conditions. This testing helps in identifying specific genetic mutations that may cause or contribute to diseases, allowing for early diagnosis and tailored treatment plans. As genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and Huntington's disease continue to impact individuals, the demand for diagnostic genetic tests in Germany has surged. With advancements in sequencing technologies, diagnostic testing has become more accurate, reliable, and accessible, making it a key driver in the market's growth.</p><p>On the other hand, predictive genetic testing is gaining traction, particularly among individuals who are at risk of developing inherited conditions without showing symptoms. Predictive testing assesses the likelihood of an individual developing conditions like Alzheimer's disease, certain cancers, or cardiovascular disorders. The growing awareness of genetic predisposition to diseases, coupled with an increasing interest in personalized medicine, has boosted the adoption of predictive testing in Germany. This segment of the market benefits from advancements in genomics and the increasing availability of comprehensive genetic screening, which enables proactive healthcare measures to prevent or manage potential health risks. As a result, predictive genetic testing is expected to witness substantial growth in the coming years.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/518336/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Hereditary Genetic Testing Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Hereditary Genetic Testing Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Hereditary Genetic Testing Market size was valued at USD 4.2 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 10.9 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 12.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Hereditary Genetic Testing Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Agilent Technologies</Li><Li> Inc</Li><Li> Ambry Genetics</Li><Li> Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI)</Li><Li> CENTOGENE AG</Li><Li> Eurofins Scientific SE</Li><Li> F.
