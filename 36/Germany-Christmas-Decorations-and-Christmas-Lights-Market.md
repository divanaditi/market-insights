Wreaths and garlands, made from natural materials or artificial designs, are also popular for adorning homes, doors, and windows during the festive season. Stockings are another key segment, typically hung for gifts and treats. These decorative items are often made from fabrics, including velvet and cotton, and feature traditional patterns and motifs such as snowflakes, reindeer, and Christmas trees. Other items like nativity sets, table centerpieces, and themed candles also contribute to the overall market, allowing for diverse seasonal décor choices that enhance the holiday spirit in homes across Germany.</p><p>In the Christmas lights market, products are typically categorized into string lights, LED lights, and decorative lights.
