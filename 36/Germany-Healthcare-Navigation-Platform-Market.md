They enhance the patient experience by reducing administrative burdens, improving access to healthcare services, and providing a seamless, user-friendly interface. This segment is experiencing rapid growth as patients seek more personalized and accessible ways to manage their healthcare needs. The demand for patient navigation tools is driven by the increasing need for better care coordination, improved patient engagement, and the desire for greater control over healthcare decisions. <p>Another prominent segment is provider navigation platforms, which are tailored to support healthcare professionals in managing patient care.
