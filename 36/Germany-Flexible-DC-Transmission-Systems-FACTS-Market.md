Series FACTS devices, such as Thyristor-Controlled Series Capacitors (TCSC) and Static Synchronous Series Compensators (SSSC), are used to improve the transmission efficiency by compensating for reactive power in the power grid. These devices enhance the stability and control of power flows, which is crucial for long-distance high-voltage DC transmission systems. The demand for Series FACTS is driven by the need for better power quality and the integration of renewable energy sources into the grid, ensuring stable and efficient energy delivery across the country. These systems offer improved voltage regulation and reduce the risk of power disruptions caused by unstable grid conditions, supporting a seamless flow of electricity across Germany’s growing transmission networks.</p><p>Shunt FACTS devices, including Static Var Compensators (SVC) and Static Synchronous Compensators (STATCOM), are designed to maintain voltage levels and provide reactive power compensation by regulating the flow of current in the transmission system. These devices are integral for stabilizing the grid, particularly in regions with fluctuating energy demand or where renewable energy sources like wind and solar are prevalent. The increasing use of Shunt FACTS in the Germany market is attributed to their ability to ensure a stable voltage profile and mitigate power system instability. The expansion of electric grids and rising adoption of advanced technologies are propelling the growth of Shunt FACTS. As the demand for sustainable energy solutions grows in Germany, these devices play a pivotal role in integrating renewable energy while maintaining the stability and reliability of the overall grid infrastructure.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/519658/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Flexible DC Transmission Systems (FACTS) Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Flexible DC Transmission Systems (FACTS) Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Flexible DC Transmission Systems (FACTS) Market size was valued at USD 3.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 6.8 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 8.9% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Flexible DC Transmission Systems (FACTS) Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>ABB</Li><Li> Siemens</Li><Li> RXPE</Li><Li> Sieyuan Electric</Li><Li> Mitsubishi Electric</Li><Li> GE</Li><Li> Toshiba</Li><Li> AMSC</Li><Li> Hyosung</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Flexible DC Transmission Systems (FACTS) Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Flexible DC Transmission Systems (FACTS) Market apart.
