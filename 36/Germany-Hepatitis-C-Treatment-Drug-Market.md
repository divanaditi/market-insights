Direct-acting antivirals are the dominant class of drugs, responsible for revolutionizing the treatment landscape due to their high efficacy, shorter treatment durations, and minimal side effects. DAAs work by targeting specific stages in the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) lifecycle, such as viral entry, replication, and assembly. These drugs are typically used in combination regimens to achieve optimal outcomes. As a result, DAAs have rapidly replaced interferon-based treatments, which were once the standard of care. The growing preference for DAAs is driven by their ability to cure a higher percentage of patients, reduced risk of side effects, and the convenience of oral formulations, making them the primary focus of pharmaceutical advancements in the country.</p><p>In contrast, interferon-based therapies, which were the backbone of Hepatitis C treatment before the advent of DAAs, are now less commonly prescribed in Germany. These therapies include pegylated interferon, often combined with ribavirin, and are associated with more side effects, such as flu-like symptoms, fatigue, and severe depression. While their use has significantly declined due to the availability of more effective alternatives, interferon-based treatments are still considered for patients who cannot access or tolerate DAAs. The segment for interferon-based therapies continues to shrink as the overall market shifts toward modern and more tolerable treatment options. However, some niche cases, including patients with specific genotypes or those with limited treatment options, may still benefit from interferon regimens, thus maintaining a smaller but persistent presence in the market.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/518736/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Hepatitis C Treatment Drug Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Hepatitis C Treatment Drug Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Hepatitis C Treatment Drug Market size was valued at USD 5.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 8.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.4% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Hepatitis C Treatment Drug Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>AbbVie</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> Bristol-Myers Squibb Company</Li><Li> F.
