These watches cater to active individuals and athletes who require advanced functionalities like GPS tracking, heart rate monitoring, and performance analytics. With higher waterproof ratings, digital waterproof watches are designed for extreme sports, underwater exploration, and outdoor adventures. The segment is driven by the increasing preference for fitness-oriented gadgets and wearables.
