Additionally, duck offals, which include organs such as liver, heart, and gizzards, are widely used in food processing, pet food manufacturing, and even pharmaceutical industries due to their nutritional value and health benefits. These segments continue to thrive as demand for diverse products in both domestic and international markets grows, fostering opportunities in various industries ranging from food production to cosmetics and textiles.</p><p>Another important segment in the market is duck meat by-products, which include processed items like sausages, pâté, and duck-based canned products. These by-products are especially popular in gourmet cooking and among consumers seeking high-protein, high-quality foods. The demand for premium duck meat by-products has seen significant growth due to their rich flavor profiles and versatility in various culinary applications. Additionally, the increasing trend of health-conscious consumers and the rise of alternative protein sources have led to more innovations in the duck by-products sector.
