The light-duty vehicle segment holds a significant share due to the increasing demand for fuel-efficient and compact steering systems in urban commercial vehicles. As cities expand, the need for vehicles that can easily navigate through traffic with better maneuverability and reduced steering effort drives the adoption of EPS. Additionally, the medium-duty vehicles segment is witnessing growth due to a rise in logistics and distribution services that require enhanced performance in steering for better control over moderate payloads. The increasing focus on improving driving comfort, reducing fuel consumption, and enhancing safety are key factors pushing the demand for EPS systems in this segment.</p><p>On the other hand, the heavy-duty vehicle segment is expected to experience substantial growth in the Germany heavy commercial vehicle EPS market. These vehicles, typically used for long-distance transportation and in industries such as construction and mining, require robust and reliable EPS systems. The demand for improved safety, driver comfort, and reduced steering effort in large commercial trucks is a significant factor. Heavy-duty vehicles also need EPS systems to manage the increased stress and weight from carrying heavy loads, especially on longer trips. Furthermore, with technological advancements in EPS systems that offer more precise control, energy efficiency, and enhanced vehicle stability, the heavy-duty segment is expected to grow steadily in the coming years. The transition from traditional hydraulic steering to electric power steering in these vehicles is accelerating due to its cost-effectiveness and reduced maintenance needs.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/517046/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Heavy Commercial Vehicle EPS Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Heavy Commercial Vehicle EPS Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Heavy Commercial Vehicle EPS Market size was valued at USD 7.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 12.3 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.4% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Heavy Commercial Vehicle EPS Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>JTEKT</Li><Li> NSK</Li><Li> Nexteer</Li><Li> ZF</Li><Li> Mobis</Li><Li> Showa</Li><Li> Thyssenkrupp</Li><Li> Mando</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Heavy Commercial Vehicle EPS Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Heavy Commercial Vehicle EPS Market apart.
