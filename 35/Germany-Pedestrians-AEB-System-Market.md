Sensor-based systems utilize technologies such as radar, LIDAR, and ultrasonic sensors to detect pedestrians within a vehicle's surroundings. These sensors can operate under various environmental conditions, offering high reliability for collision avoidance. Radar sensors are particularly effective in detecting objects even in poor visibility conditions, while LIDAR and ultrasonic sensors help in close-range detection. These systems are typically employed in mid-range vehicles and are popular due to their robust performance in diverse weather conditions. As the demand for advanced safety features increases in Germany, sensor-based AEB systems continue to gain prominence, ensuring a higher level of pedestrian protection in urban environments.</p><p>On the other hand, camera-based systems rely on optical sensors and image recognition software to identify pedestrians on the road. These systems are more reliant on visual input, providing high accuracy in clear weather conditions. Camera-based AEB systems are generally integrated with advanced driver-assistance technologies like lane departure warnings and traffic sign recognition, enhancing overall vehicle safety. While their effectiveness may decrease in challenging weather, advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning are improving the reliability of these systems. Camera-based AEB systems are commonly found in higher-end and luxury vehicles, where cutting-edge technologies are prioritized. The growing awareness of pedestrian safety and regulatory pressure in Germany is driving the adoption of these systems in various segments of the automotive industry.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/517270/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Pedestrians AEB System Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Pedestrians AEB System Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Pedestrians AEB System Market size was valued at USD 2.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 6.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 15.2% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Pedestrians AEB System Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>ZF TRW</Li><Li> Continental AG</Li><Li> DENSO Corporation</Li><Li> Tesla Motors</Li><Li> Robert Bosch GmbH</Li><Li> Delphi Automotive Plc.</Li><Li> Autoliv Inc.</Li><Li> Magna International Inc.</Li><Li> Mobileye NV</Li><Li> Volvo Car Corporation</Li><Li> Ford Motor</Li><Li> Daimler</Li><Li> Audi</Li><Li> Volkswagen</Li><Li> Toyota Motor</Li><Li> Honda Motor</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Pedestrians AEB System Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Pedestrians AEB System Market apart.
