Synthetic sponges can be manufactured in various shapes, sizes, and textures, making them suitable for different skin types and cleansing routines. Their widespread use in the beauty industry is driven by their cost-effectiveness and availability in a variety of formulations, such as those designed for deep exfoliation or gentle cleansing.
