One of the key categories is thermoplastic welding rods, which are highly favored due to their ability to fuse with other thermoplastic materials under heat. These rods are used in welding plastics such as PVC, PP, PE, and others. They are known for their versatility and ease of use, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, including automotive, construction, and plumbing industries. These rods provide strong welds and have excellent durability, ensuring long-lasting performance in demanding environments. As the demand for sustainable and recyclable materials grows, thermoplastic rods are gaining popularity in the German market for their recyclability and cost-effectiveness in various repair and manufacturing processes.</p><p>Another significant segment in the market is the thermoset welding rods. These rods are primarily used for plastics that undergo chemical changes when heated, making them less suitable for recycling but highly resistant to heat and chemicals. Thermoset rods are commonly utilized in applications where strength and resistance to harsh environments are crucial, such as in the aerospace, electronics, and heavy machinery industries. While the market for thermoset rods is smaller compared to thermoplastics, it is growing steadily due to the increasing demand for specialized solutions in high-performance applications.
