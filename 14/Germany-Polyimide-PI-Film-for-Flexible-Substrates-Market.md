Single-sided PI films are widely used in various industries for applications such as flexible electronics, printed circuit boards (PCBs), and insulating materials due to their durability and high thermal resistance. These films are ideal for applications where only one side of the film needs to be processed or bonded to other substrates. They are typically more cost-effective compared to their double-sided counterparts, making them suitable for a variety of low- to mid-volume applications that require a balance of performance and affordability. As demand for flexible electronics and high-performance devices increases, single-sided PI films are expected to experience steady growth in Germany's industrial sectors.</p><p>Double-sided PI films, on the other hand, are gaining significant traction in the German market due to their enhanced properties and versatility in high-end applications. These films are often used in applications requiring superior performance in terms of insulation, strength, and resistance to high temperatures on both sides. Industries such as aerospace, automotive, and telecommunications benefit from the advanced capabilities of double-sided PI films, where both sides of the film must maintain consistent electrical insulation and structural integrity.
