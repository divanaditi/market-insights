Corticosteroids, including prednisone and deflazacort, dominate the market as they are the most commonly prescribed drugs for DMD patients. These drugs help reduce muscle inflammation and slow down the progression of muscle weakness. Corticosteroids are often used as a long-term treatment option for DMD, with the goal of extending the motor function of affected individuals. Despite the side effects associated with long-term use, such as weight gain and bone weakening, corticosteroids continue to be the standard of care in Germany. They are available in oral and injectable forms, with patients typically receiving treatment from an early age to manage the disease's progression.<p>Gene therapy represents a newer, emerging segment in the Germany DMD drugs market, showing promising potential for curbing the progression of the disease at a genetic level. This type of therapy involves using viral vectors or other delivery mechanisms to introduce a corrected version of the dystrophin gene into the patient’s cells, addressing the root cause of DMD. Several gene therapies are in various stages of clinical trials and have shown encouraging results in increasing dystrophin production, which is essential for muscle function. While gene therapies hold great promise for DMD treatment in Germany, they are still not as widely adopted due to their high cost and the complexity of administration. However, as research continues and more therapies gain regulatory approval, gene therapy is expected to grow in significance, offering hope for improved treatment outcomes for DMD patients in the coming years.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/850116/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Drugs Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Drugs Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Drugs Market size was valued at USD 3.2 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 6.8 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 10.2% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Drugs Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Akashi Therapeutics Inc Antisense Therapeutics Ltd</Li><Li> Beech Tree Labs Inc Biogen Inc Bioleaders Corp</Li><Li> BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc Biophytis SAS</Li><Li> Capricor Therapeutics Inc Catabasis Pharmaceuticals Inc CRISPR Therapeutics</Li><Li> Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd</Li><Li> Debiopharm International SA</Li><Li> Editas Medicine Inc Eloxx Pharmaceuticals Inc F.
