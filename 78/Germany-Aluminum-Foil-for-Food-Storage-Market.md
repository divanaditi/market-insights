The household aluminum foil segment holds a significant share, driven by the increasing demand for convenient food storage solutions among consumers. This type of foil is typically used for wrapping food items, preserving freshness, and facilitating cooking, baking, or grilling. With growing awareness about food preservation and sustainability, consumers prefer aluminum foil for its ability to keep food fresh for longer periods while being recyclable. Additionally, the rise in single-person households and the trend of home cooking have further boosted demand for household aluminum foil products in Germany.</p><p>On the other hand, the industrial aluminum foil segment caters to a wide range of applications in the food packaging industry, where larger quantities of food products are stored or transported. This type of foil is characterized by its durable, high-performance qualities that allow it to withstand varying temperatures and protect food from external contaminants. With the expansion of food production and packaging industries, industrial aluminum foil continues to play a vital role in maintaining the quality and safety of food during distribution.
