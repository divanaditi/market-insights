Prescription painkillers include opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and other medications that require a doctor's authorization. Opioids, such as morphine and oxycodone, are often prescribed for severe pain, especially in post-surgical or cancer patients, but their use is tightly regulated due to the risk of addiction. NSAIDs like ibuprofen and diclofenac are commonly prescribed for moderate pain relief, such as arthritis or muscular pain. Other prescription painkillers, such as anticonvulsants and antidepressants, are also used for managing chronic pain, particularly neuropathic conditions. The demand for prescription painkillers has seen fluctuations due to increasing awareness of addiction risks, but they remain a significant part of the pain relief market in Germany.</p><p>On the other hand, over-the-counter (OTC) painkillers dominate the retail market due to their easy accessibility without a doctor's prescription. Common OTC painkillers include NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, aspirin, and paracetamol, which are used for mild to moderate pain relief, such as headaches, menstrual cramps, and minor injuries. These medications are often preferred by consumers for their convenience and effectiveness. OTC painkillers are widely available in pharmacies, supermarkets, and online platforms.
