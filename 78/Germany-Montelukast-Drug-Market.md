Montelukast Tablets are the most widely used form of the drug, accounting for a significant portion of the market share. This form is typically prescribed for both adults and children over the age of six, as it offers convenience and precise dosage control. The tablets are available in different strengths, which allows healthcare providers to tailor treatment based on the severity of the patient's condition. Given its effectiveness in treating asthma and allergic rhinitis, Montelukast Tablets are popular among patients seeking long-term management of these conditions, contributing to their strong market presence in Germany.<p>On the other hand, Montelukast Oral Granules are primarily used for pediatric patients, particularly children between the ages of six months and five years. The oral granules are designed for easy administration, as they can be mixed with soft food or liquid, ensuring that younger patients can take the medication without difficulty. Although they represent a smaller share of the market compared to tablets, the demand for Montelukast Oral Granules is growing steadily as awareness of its benefits for young children increases. This segment continues to expand as more healthcare providers recommend Montelukast for the management of asthma and allergic rhinitis in early childhood, driving the market for oral granules in Germany.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/849960/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Montelukast Drug Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Montelukast Drug Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Montelukast Drug Market size was valued at USD 5.8 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 8.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 4.7% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Montelukast Drug Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Merck & Co.</Li><Li> Teva</Li><Li> Mylan</Li><Li> Glenmark Pharmaceuticals</Li><Li> Hikma Group</Li><Li> Sandoz</Li><Li> Torrent Pharmaceuticals</Li><Li> Lannett Company</Li><Li> Apotex</Li><Li> Dr. Reddys Laboratories</Li><Li> Aurobindo Pharma</Li><Li> Accord Healthcare</Li><Li> Hetero</Li><Li> Unimark</Li><Li> Ajanta Pharma</Li><Li> MACLEODS</Li><Li> Jubilant Pharma</Li><Li> Unichem Laboratories</Li><Li> Amneal Pharmaceuticals</Li><Li> Shanghai Anbison Lab</Li><Li> Perrigo</Li><Li> Cipla</Li><Li> CSPC Ouyi Pharmaceutical</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Montelukast Drug Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Montelukast Drug Market apart.
