Prescription medications are a significant component of the market, as they are typically used to treat more severe and chronic GI conditions such as Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). These drugs include biologics, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive agents. Prescription treatments are often tailored to the specific needs of the patient and administered under medical supervision, reflecting the complexity of managing GI diseases that require long-term management or urgent intervention. The demand for prescription GI drugs in Germany continues to rise as healthcare advancements enable better diagnosis and treatment outcomes for complex GI disorders.<p>On the other hand, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs play an important role in the German gastrointestinal market by providing consumers with accessible treatments for mild and transient GI issues such as indigestion, heartburn, constipation, and bloating. OTC drugs primarily include antacids, anti-gas medications, laxatives, and anti-diarrheal agents. These products are readily available at pharmacies and can be purchased without a prescription, making them a convenient option for individuals seeking immediate relief from common gastrointestinal discomforts. The growing awareness of gastrointestinal health and a preference for self-medication have contributed to the steady growth of the OTC segment in Germany. As consumer confidence in OTC drugs increases, the market for these products is expected to expand, particularly in the context of an aging population and busy lifestyles.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/853760/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Gastrointestinal Drugs Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Gastrointestinal Drugs Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Gastrointestinal Drugs Market size was valued at USD 30 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 45 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.1% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Gastrointestinal Drugs Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>AstraZeneca</Li><Li> Sanofi</Li><Li> Bayer</Li><Li> Pfizer</Li><Li> GlaxoSmithKline</Li><Li> Teva</Li><Li> Zeria Tillotts </Li><Li> Perrigo</Li><Li> Boehringer Ingelheim</Li><Li> Purdue Pharma</Li><Li> C.B.
