Statins, including atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, dominate as the first-line therapeutic agents. These statins effectively reduce cholesterol levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme responsible for cholesterol production in the liver. Along with statins, additional lipid-lowering therapies like ezetimibe, which inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption, are commonly used in combination. Statins and ezetimibe combination therapy is often the preferred treatment in cases of moderate HoFH severity. The use of these therapies has shown significant effectiveness in lowering LDL cholesterol and improving overall cardiovascular health in patients suffering from HoFH.<p>Another important category in the treatment of HoFH includes PCSK9 inhibitors, such as evolocumab and alirocumab. These monoclonal antibodies target the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) protein, which regulates LDL receptor levels in the liver. By inhibiting PCSK9, these treatments increase the liver's ability to remove LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream, leading to a substantial reduction in cholesterol levels. Furthermore, lipoprotein apheresis, a therapeutic procedure that involves the mechanical removal of excess lipoproteins from the blood, is an essential treatment for patients with severe HoFH who do not respond to drug therapies. This form of treatment is typically considered for patients with the highest risk of cardiovascular complications. The combination of drug therapies and medical procedures enhances the treatment options available in managing the disease effectively.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/851416/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia Treatment Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia Treatment Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia Treatment Market size was valued at USD 1.50 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 3.10 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 9.50% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia Treatment Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>CymaBay Therapeutics Inc Daewoong Co Ltd</Li><Li> Gemphire Therapeutics Inc LipimetiX Development Inc Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc RegenxBio Inc The Medicines Company</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia Treatment Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia Treatment Market apart.
