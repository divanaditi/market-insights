Biscuits, on the other hand, are widely appreciated for their convenience and variety of flavors. These treats come in different shapes and sizes, often tailored to meet specific dietary needs or health concerns, such as grain-free or low-fat options. As pet owners become more conscientious about their pets' health, biscuits made from organic or locally sourced ingredients are gaining popularity across Germany. <p>Jerky treats, another significant segment in the market, appeal to dogs that enjoy high-protein, savory snacks. These treats are typically made from dried meats like chicken, beef, or fish, ensuring a rich source of protein without artificial preservatives or flavorings. In Germany, the demand for jerky treats is on the rise as pet owners seek premium, natural snacks to keep their dogs satisfied and healthy.
