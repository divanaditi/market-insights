Prescription drugs for insomnia include medications such as benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepine sleep aids, and certain antidepressants that are commonly prescribed to treat chronic insomnia. These drugs are generally more potent and are typically prescribed when over-the-counter options are not effective. Due to their potential side effects, prescription drugs are usually used under the supervision of healthcare professionals. In Germany, the growing prevalence of insomnia, coupled with the increasing awareness about sleep disorders, is driving the demand for prescription-based treatments. Healthcare providers often recommend these drugs when insomnia is associated with underlying conditions such as anxiety, depression, or chronic pain.<p>On the other hand, over-the-counter (OTC) insomnia treatments are widely available and include antihistamines, melatonin, and herbal supplements. These drugs are considered safer for short-term use, and their availability without a prescription makes them an attractive option for individuals seeking relief from occasional sleep disturbances. OTC drugs are commonly used for mild to moderate insomnia, and their popularity is rising due to their relatively low cost and ease of access. Melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep cycles, has gained particular attention in recent years for its effectiveness in treating jet lag and circadian rhythm disorders. The growing preference for self-medication and the increased availability of natural or herbal-based treatments are contributing factors to the market growth of OTC insomnia drugs in Germany.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/854696/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Insomnia Treatment Drugs Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Insomnia Treatment Drugs Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Insomnia Treatment Drugs Market size was valued at USD 4.6 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 6.5 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 4.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Insomnia Treatment Drugs Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>F.Hoffman La-Roche AG</Li><Li> Merck & Co.
