The putty segment holds a significant share due to its easy handling and versatility in various orthopedic surgeries. Putty DBM products are favored for their high osteoinductive properties, promoting bone growth and healing. Gel forms are also gaining traction as they provide better conformability and can be easily applied to irregular bone surfaces. The gel is often used for complex or minimally invasive surgeries, contributing to its growing market presence in Germany.</p><p>Granules and strips form the other key segments within the DBM market in Germany. Granules are typically used for spine and joint surgeries due to their capacity to fill voids and support bone regeneration. Strips, often used in reconstructive surgeries, are favored for their ease of placement and stability. These products offer enhanced handling characteristics and can be applied to a wide range of clinical situations. The demand for these DBM types is expected to grow as surgeons increasingly adopt bone graft substitutes in various procedures across the country.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/851518/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Allograft Demineralized Bone Matrix Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Allograft Demineralized Bone Matrix Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Allograft Demineralized Bone Matrix Market size was valued at USD 1.12 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 1.84 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.0% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Allograft Demineralized Bone Matrix Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Medtronic</Li><Li> J &J (DePuy Synthes)</Li><Li> SeaSpine</Li><Li> Xtant Medical</Li><Li> Zimmer Biomet</Li><Li> Stryker</Li><Li> Straumann</Li><Li> Wright Medical Group</Li><Li> Hans Biomed</Li><Li> Arthrex</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Allograft Demineralized Bone Matrix Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Allograft Demineralized Bone Matrix Market apart.
