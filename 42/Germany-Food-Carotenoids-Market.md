Beta-carotene is widely used in food products such as beverages, dairy, and baked goods due to its high antioxidant properties and ability to promote eye health. As a precursor to Vitamin A, beta-carotene remains a key ingredient in functional food products, offering nutritional benefits to consumers. Additionally, the growing trend of plant-based and fortified food products boosts the demand for beta-carotene, particularly among health-conscious consumers. Its applications span across the food and beverage sector, especially in products targeting health-conscious individuals and those with specific dietary needs.<p>Another significant segment in the market includes lutein, which is increasingly popular due to its role in supporting eye health. Lutein is primarily used in dietary supplements, functional foods, and beverages. With the rise in aging populations and an increasing awareness of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), lutein has become a key ingredient in products aimed at enhancing eye function. Additionally, other carotenoids such as astaxanthin and zeaxanthin are gaining traction in the German market. These carotenoids are incorporated into premium health and wellness products, offering distinct benefits like anti-inflammatory properties and antioxidant activity. Their inclusion in specialized supplements and food products is expected to rise as consumers seek out more targeted nutritional benefits.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/560952/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Food Carotenoids Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Food Carotenoids Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Food Carotenoids Market size was valued at USD 1.9 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 3.1 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.2% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Food Carotenoids Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>DSM</Li><Li> BASF</Li><Li> Allied Biotech</Li><Li> Chenguang Biotech</Li><Li> FMC</Li><Li> Dohler</Li><Li> Chr.
