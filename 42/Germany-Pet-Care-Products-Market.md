Pet food, including dry food, wet food, and treats, represents a dominant segment due to its essential nature in pet care. With the growing trend of premium and organic pet food options, consumers are increasingly looking for specialized diets to meet the nutritional needs of their pets. Grooming products, including shampoos, conditioners, brushes, and flea treatments, are also in high demand as pet owners focus on maintaining their pets' hygiene and appearance. Additionally, healthcare products such as vitamins, supplements, and medicines have seen significant growth as more pet owners are prioritizing their pets' health and well-being. The accessories segment includes products like pet clothing, beds, toys, and carriers. These products have gained popularity due to the increasing humanization of pets, with owners treating them as family members and providing them with comfort and entertainment. Furthermore, advancements in pet technology, such as smart pet products, are contributing to the expansion of the accessories market. As disposable income increases, German pet owners are increasingly willing to spend on innovative and high-quality pet accessories that enhance their pets' quality of life.
