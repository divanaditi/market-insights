One prominent type is the foldable walking stick, which offers portability and convenience. These sticks are compact and can be easily stored or carried when not in use. They are particularly popular among individuals who travel frequently or those with limited storage space. Another significant type is the adjustable walking stick, which provides flexibility by allowing users to customize the height according to their needs. This feature enhances comfort and ergonomics, making it an ideal choice for users seeking personalized support. The adjustable walking stick segment is gaining traction due to its adaptability for people with varying physical requirements, making it a preferred option for many seniors and individuals with mobility challenges in Germany.</p><p>Additionally, the market includes specialized types such as walking sticks with built-in LED lights, shock-absorbing walking sticks, and those with ergonomic handles. The incorporation of advanced features in these products caters to the evolving needs of an aging population, improving both functionality and safety.
