The demand for standard extract continues to grow due to its proven benefits and broad consumer base, including both health-conscious individuals and those seeking anti-aging solutions. The versatility and cost-effectiveness of this type ensure its widespread presence across various market segments in Germany.</p><p>On the other hand, the high-polyphenol extract segment is experiencing a surge in demand, driven by an increasing consumer preference for premium, potent antioxidant products.
