MOP is the most widely used potash fertilizer type, accounting for a large portion of the market share. It is predominantly used in agricultural applications for crops such as cereals, vegetables, and fruits, owing to its affordability and effective potassium content. MOP is generally preferred by farmers looking for cost-effective solutions to enhance soil fertility and promote crop growth. With Germany's diverse agricultural sector, the demand for MOP remains high, driven by its ability to improve plant yield and resistance to environmental stresses, making it an essential component in the country's agricultural practices.</p><p>SOP, on the other hand, is a more specialized product, catering to high-value crops like fruits, vegetables, and some types of flowers. It contains a lower chloride concentration compared to MOP, making it particularly suitable for crops sensitive to chloride toxicity. The growing trend toward organic farming and sustainable agricultural practices has fueled the demand for SOP in Germany. This segment is expanding as farmers seek more eco-friendly alternatives that improve soil health without negatively impacting the environment.
