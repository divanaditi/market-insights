Friction modifiers enhance the lubrication properties of oils, reducing wear and improving engine efficiency, particularly in high-performance engines. Viscosity index improvers play a crucial role in maintaining the fluidity of oil under extreme temperatures, ensuring better engine protection. Anti-wear agents reduce metal-to-metal contact, prolonging engine life and reducing maintenance costs. Dispersants keep contaminants suspended in the oil, preventing sludge buildup and maintaining oil cleanliness. These types of additives contribute significantly to the improved performance and longevity of automotive and industrial engines, making them critical to the growing demand for high-performance oils in the German market. Each type is continuously evolving with advancements in nanotechnology, leading to more efficient and environmentally friendly products.</p><p>Another significant category of oil additives in the German market is the corrosion inhibitors. These additives help to prevent the formation of rust and corrosion on engine parts, thus extending the operational life of machinery and vehicles. Nano-based corrosion inhibitors are highly effective due to their ability to provide a more uniform protective layer that resists the effects of oxidation. The market also includes extreme pressure additives, which are formulated to withstand high-stress conditions, such as those found in heavy-duty industrial machinery.
