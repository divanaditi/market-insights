One of the most popular types is the manual mug heat press, which offers affordability and simplicity. This type is ideal for small-scale businesses or home-based entrepreneurs. These presses rely on hand-operated controls and are often seen as an entry-level solution for those new to the customization market. Their basic design, combined with easy operation, makes them appealing to individuals seeking a cost-effective and straightforward option. Manual presses are commonly used for custom printing on mugs, especially when dealing with limited production runs or personalized gifts.
