Titanium-based implants dominate the market due to their superior biocompatibility, strength, and long-term performance. These implants are favored for their ability to integrate well with the jawbone through osseointegration, a key factor in ensuring implant success. The titanium nano surface enhances osseointegration by increasing the surface area, making the implants more stable and durable over time. Additionally, titanium implants are versatile and can be used for a wide range of dental applications, which contributes to their widespread use in the German market. The continued advancements in nano-surface technology further boost the popularity of titanium-based implants, providing better outcomes for patients seeking reliable and effective dental solutions.</p><p>On the other hand, zirconia-based dental implants are gaining traction due to their aesthetic appeal and biocompatibility. These implants are made from a high-strength ceramic material that is naturally white, making them an attractive option for patients seeking a more natural-looking replacement. Zirconia nano surface implants offer several advantages, including reduced plaque accumulation and a lower risk of gum inflammation. Although zirconia implants are relatively newer compared to titanium implants, their popularity is growing, particularly among patients who value aesthetics and a metal-free dental solution.
