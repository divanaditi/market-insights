They are commonly used in beverages, baked goods, and dietary supplements, serving as a preferred choice for those managing calorie intake or seeking weight management solutions. The demand for low-calorie sweeteners continues to grow as consumers seek healthier alternatives to refined sugars and artificial sweeteners, which are often associated with health concerns like obesity and diabetes.<p>Another significant segment in the Germany natural functional sugar market is functional sugars like coconut sugar and date sugar.
