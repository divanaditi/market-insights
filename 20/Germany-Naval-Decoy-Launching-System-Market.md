Active decoys, which include systems like radar, infrared, and acoustic decoys, are designed to counter specific threats such as guided missiles and torpedoes. These decoys work by emitting signals or noise to deceive incoming threats, making them a critical component of modern naval defense strategies. Active decoy systems are gaining traction due to their effectiveness in protecting vessels from sophisticated threats, especially in hostile environments. The market for these systems is expected to grow as naval defense forces seek advanced solutions for enhancing ship survivability and operational effectiveness. <p>On the other hand, passive decoys, which do not emit signals but instead rely on physical characteristics such as heat signatures, radar cross-section, or acoustic emissions, are also a significant part of the German naval decoy launching system market. These systems work by providing misleading information to incoming threats, helping to misdirect or confuse targeting systems. The advantage of passive decoys is that they require fewer resources, which makes them cost-effective and easier to deploy in large quantities. As military forces continue to prioritize cost-effective yet efficient defense solutions, passive decoys are gaining momentum in the market.
