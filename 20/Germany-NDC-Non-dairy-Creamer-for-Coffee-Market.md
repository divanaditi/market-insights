Powdered non-dairy creamer holds a significant share of the market due to its long shelf life, convenience, and cost-effectiveness. It is widely preferred in both households and commercial coffee establishments, where it is used to enhance the flavor and texture of coffee. Additionally, powdered creamers offer easy storage and portability, making them a popular choice for both consumers and businesses. This type of non-dairy creamer is commonly available in various flavors, such as vanilla, hazelnut, and caramel, catering to diverse consumer preferences.<p>On the other hand, liquid non-dairy creamers are gaining popularity for their smooth texture and easy mixing with coffee. Liquid creamers offer a premium experience, providing a creamier, richer taste compared to powdered variants. As consumers demand more convenient and ready-to-use products, the demand for liquid creamers has increased, especially in the café and restaurant sectors. The liquid form also appeals to those seeking healthier alternatives, as many products are formulated with lower sugar content and added nutrients. The shift towards liquid creamers reflects changing consumer trends towards better-quality and premium coffee experiences.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/403066/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany NDC (Non-dairy Creamer) for Coffee Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany NDC (Non-dairy Creamer) for Coffee Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>NDC (Non-dairy Creamer) for Coffee Market size was valued at USD 2.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 4.1 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.2% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany NDC (Non-dairy Creamer) for Coffee Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Nestle</Li><Li> Kerry Group</Li><Li> WhiteWave (International Delight)</Li><Li> FrieslandCampina</Li><Li> DEK(Grandos)</Li><Li> DMK(TURM</Li><Li> DP Supply)</Li><Li> Barry Callebaut (Caprimo)</Li><Li> Super Group</Li><Li> Yearrakarn</Li><Li> Custom Food Group</Li><Li> PT.
