They are equipped with specialized compartments for items such as defibrillators, oxygen tanks, and airway management tools. These carts are designed to be mobile, enabling swift transportation within medical facilities during emergencies. Additionally, anesthesia carts provide specific storage for anesthetic drugs and equipment, ensuring that these vital supplies are readily available during surgical procedures.</p><p>General-purpose medical supply carts serve a broader role in healthcare environments, offering a versatile storage solution for various medical tools and instruments. These carts are commonly found in patient care areas, where they facilitate easy access to non-specialized medical supplies.
