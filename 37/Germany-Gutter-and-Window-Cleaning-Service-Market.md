Commercial and industrial gutter cleaning services are growing, driven by the need for regular maintenance of large buildings, office complexes, and manufacturing facilities. These sectors require specialized equipment and higher safety standards, which increases demand for professional cleaning services. The diversity of services offered, such as one-time cleaning or periodic maintenance contracts, also contributes to the growth of this segment, as customers prefer tailored solutions for different property sizes and usage types.</p><p>On the other hand, the window cleaning service market in Germany is divided into similar categories: residential, commercial, and industrial.
