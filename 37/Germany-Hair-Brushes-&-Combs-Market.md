The most popular category is the traditional hairbrush, available in a variety of designs such as paddle brushes, round brushes, and vented brushes. Paddle brushes are widely used due to their versatility and effectiveness in detangling hair, while round brushes are essential for styling, adding volume, and creating curls. Vented brushes are designed for faster drying and are favored by individuals with thicker or longer hair. These types of brushes dominate the market due to their broad appeal among different consumer demographics, from daily users to professionals in salons.</p><p>Another significant category in the market is combs, which come in a range of materials such as plastic, wood, and metal. Wide-tooth combs are especially popular for detangling wet hair without causing breakage, while fine-tooth combs are used for precision styling and parting. The growing trend of eco-conscious consumer behavior has led to increased demand for wooden and biodegradable combs. Additionally, pocket-sized combs have gained traction due to their convenience and portability.
