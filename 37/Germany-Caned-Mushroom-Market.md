They are the most commonly consumed type in canned mushroom products, appealing to a broad consumer base. Their use in a wide range of culinary applications, from soups to stir-fries, drives their significant demand in the canned food industry. In addition to white mushrooms, brown mushrooms also hold a substantial share of the market.
