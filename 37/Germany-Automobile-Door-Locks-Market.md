These locks operate through traditional key systems, providing reliability and ease of use for vehicle owners. Mechanical door locks are typically favored in budget-friendly or older vehicle models, where simplicity and cost-efficiency are prioritized. However, with the growing demand for advanced security solutions, the market is also witnessing a rise in electronic and smart locks. Electronic locks, powered by motors and sensors, offer enhanced safety features, such as keyless entry, and are increasingly incorporated in mid-range to high-end vehicles.
