Infrared sensors are widely used due to their ability to detect raindrops efficiently through infrared light reflection. These sensors consist of emitters and receivers, where the interruption of the light beam caused by water droplets triggers the wiper system. Infrared sensors are preferred for their accuracy, speed, and reliability in a wide range of environmental conditions. These features make them highly effective for modern vehicles, where optimal performance during heavy rain is essential for driver safety and convenience.</p><p>On the other hand, capacitive sensors function by detecting changes in the dielectric constant caused by the presence of water on the windshield. The increasing demand for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) has contributed to the growth of capacitive sensors in the market. These sensors offer high sensitivity and low power consumption, making them suitable for integration into next-generation vehicles with smart wiper systems. Capacitive sensors also provide enhanced performance in varied climatic conditions, adding to their popularity in the German automotive industry.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/591596/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Automotive Rain Sensor Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Automotive Rain Sensor Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Automotive Rain Sensor Market Market size was valued at USD 2.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 4.1 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Automotive Rain Sensor Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Denso Corporation (Japan)</Li><Li> HELLA KGaA Hueck & Co.
