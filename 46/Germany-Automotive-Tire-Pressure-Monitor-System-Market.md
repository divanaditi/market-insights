Direct TPMS uses sensors attached to each tire to measure tire pressure in real-time. These sensors transmit data to the vehicle's central system, providing accurate readings of each tire's pressure. This type of TPMS is highly valued for its precision and ability to alert drivers to tire issues immediately. With increasing safety awareness and regulatory pressure, direct TPMS adoption is on the rise in Germany, especially in passenger vehicles and commercial fleets. Its ability to reduce tire-related accidents and enhance fuel efficiency further contributes to its popularity in the market.<p>On the other hand, indirect TPMS functions by monitoring the rotational speed of each tire. By comparing the data from the tires, the system detects any significant changes in the circumference, which may indicate a loss in pressure. While indirect TPMS is generally more cost-effective and easier to install, it lacks the real-time tire pressure monitoring of the direct system. Despite this, its demand continues to grow in certain vehicle segments due to its simpler installation process and lower maintenance costs. The rise in the adoption of indirect TPMS, particularly in mid-range and economy vehicle categories, is helping expand its market share in Germany, making it a viable solution for various automotive manufacturers and consumers alike.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/592292/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Automotive Tire Pressure Monitor System Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Automotive Tire Pressure Monitor System Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Automotive Tire Pressure Monitor System Market size was valued at USD 3.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 6.1 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 8.1% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Automotive Tire Pressure Monitor System Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li> Sensata Technologies Inc</Li><Li> Continental AG</Li><Li> Pacific Industrial Co.
