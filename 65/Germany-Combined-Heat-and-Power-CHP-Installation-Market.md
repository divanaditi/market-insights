These technologies typically include gas engines, steam turbines, and organic Rankine cycle (ORC) systems. Gas engines are among the most widely used due to their high efficiency and ability to be deployed in both industrial and residential settings. The adoption of gas engines is supported by their ability to generate both heat and electricity simultaneously, offering a more sustainable and cost-effective solution for energy generation. The preference for gas engines is driven by their relatively lower carbon emissions compared to other fossil fuel-based technologies, making them ideal for meeting Germany’s strict environmental regulations and energy transition goals.<p>Steam turbines are another significant segment within the CHP market in Germany, particularly suited for large-scale industrial applications. Steam turbines provide a robust solution for sectors requiring high levels of thermal energy, such as manufacturing and chemical production. Their ability to efficiently convert thermal energy into mechanical energy has made them a staple in high-efficiency CHP plants. Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) systems, on the other hand, are gaining traction for smaller, decentralized applications. These systems are ideal for utilizing low-temperature heat sources and are commonly used in industries like biomass, waste-to-energy, and geothermal.
