Bare-metal stents are traditionally used in coronary artery procedures, offering a simple solution for preventing vessel re-narrowing. However, these stents lack the ability to release drugs, which limits their effectiveness in more complex cases of restenosis. In contrast, polymer-based drug-eluting stents are designed to release drugs that help prevent the re-occlusion of arteries by inhibiting cellular growth within the stented area. These stents are widely preferred due to their superior performance in reducing the risk of restenosis, especially in high-risk patients. As a result, the demand for polymer-based DES has been increasing in Germany, driving market growth and innovation in stent technology. <p>Another important segment in the market is the biodegradable stents, which are gaining traction in Germany due to their ability to dissolve naturally within the body after serving their purpose. These stents are designed to gradually degrade over time, which reduces the long-term risks associated with permanent metallic implants. Biodegradable drug-eluting stents offer the benefit of eliminating the need for additional surgeries to remove the stent, thereby reducing patient recovery time and healthcare costs. Although they currently represent a smaller portion of the market, the demand for biodegradable DES is expected to grow as clinical outcomes improve and more patients seek advanced, minimally invasive treatment options. This segment is likely to experience significant growth in the coming years, owing to ongoing research and technological advancements aimed at improving the stent’s efficacy and safety profile.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/743560/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Cardiovascular Drug-Eluting Stents(DES) Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Cardiovascular Drug-Eluting Stents(DES) Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Cardiovascular Drug-Eluting Stents(DES) Market size was valued at USD 7.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 12.3 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.6% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Cardiovascular Drug-Eluting Stents(DES) Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>MIV Therapeutics</Li><Li> Orbusneich</Li><Li> Promed Medical</Li><Li> Relisys Medical</Li><Li> Reva Medical</Li><Li> Sahajanand</Li><Li> Sino Medical</Li><Li> Sorin</Li><Li> Terumo Medical</Li><Li> Abbott Vascular</Li><Li> Advantec Vascular</Li><Li> B.Braun Melsengen AG</Li><Li> Biosensors</Li><Li> Boston Scientific</Li><Li> MicroPort Medical</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Cardiovascular Drug-Eluting Stents(DES) Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Cardiovascular Drug-Eluting Stents(DES) Market apart.
