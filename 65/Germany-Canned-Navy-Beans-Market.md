Whole canned navy beans are the most common type in the market, providing consumers with a convenient and ready-to-use option for various dishes.

The popularity of whole beans can be attributed to their versatility in recipes, ease of preparation, and long shelf life. Whole canned beans are often preferred by households and foodservice establishments for their practicality and ability to maintain their nutritional value over time.</p><p>On the other hand, mashed canned navy beans are becoming increasingly popular due to their convenience in ready-to-eat meals and as a base for dips and spreads. This type offers a smoother texture, which is ideal for products like bean dips, spreads, and baby food. As demand for quick and easy meal solutions rises, mashed beans are gaining traction among consumers seeking more processed and time-saving food options.
