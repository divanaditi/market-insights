XLR cables dominate the market due to their superior performance in professional audio setups. They provide balanced connections that reduce noise interference, making them ideal for use in live sound environments, studios, and broadcasting. Their robust construction ensures durability and long-term use, which further strengthens their demand across multiple audio applications. The increasing need for high-quality, reliable audio connections in the entertainment and media sectors drives the widespread adoption of XLR cables in Germany's market.</p><p>On the other hand, TRS cables are gaining popularity due to their versatility and wide range of applications. These cables are often used in musical instruments, audio mixers, and home audio systems, offering excellent signal quality and ease of use. With the growing demand for portable and cost-effective audio solutions, TRS cables are increasingly being favored by smaller-scale performers, content creators, and home studio setups.
