Pharmaceutical-grade products are typically prescribed by medical professionals and are used to treat specific medical conditions such as chronic pain, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis. These products undergo rigorous testing for quality, efficacy, and safety, and are approved by regulatory authorities before they can be distributed. The demand for pharmaceutical-grade cannabis-based medicines is largely driven by the increasing number of patients seeking alternatives to traditional treatments for various chronic ailments, as well as the growing acceptance of cannabis in medical communities across Germany.</p><p>On the other hand, cannabis-based OTC products are available without a prescription and are often used for general wellness purposes. These include products such as CBD oils, capsules, and topical creams, which are marketed for their potential benefits in areas like stress relief, sleep improvement, and skin health. The growing trend toward natural and alternative therapies has contributed to the expansion of this segment, as more consumers turn to cannabis-based OTC products for preventive care and self-management of minor ailments. Both segments are expected to see substantial growth as legal and regulatory frameworks evolve to support the widespread use of cannabis-based medicines in Germany.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/749206/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Cannabis-based Medicines Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Cannabis-based Medicines Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Cannabis-based Medicines Market size was valued at USD 5.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 20.3 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 17.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Cannabis-based Medicines Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>GW Pharmaceuticals plc</Li><Li> INSYS Therapeutics</Li><Li> Aequus Pharmaceuticals</Li><Li> Axim Biotechnologies</Li><Li> Revive Therapeutics</Li><Li> MGC Pharmaceuticals</Li><Li> ECHO Pharmaceuticals</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Cannabis-based Medicines Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Cannabis-based Medicines Market apart.
