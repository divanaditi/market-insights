Stationary bikes also play a significant role in the market, favored for low-impact cardio workouts, especially among older adults or those with joint concerns. These machines are available in upright and recumbent variations, appealing to a diverse customer base. The demand for ellipticals is also increasing, as they provide a full-body workout with minimal stress on joints, making them a preferred choice for users looking for a low-impact alternative to running or cycling.</p><p>Rowing machines are another essential segment in the Germany cardio equipment market, offering a full-body workout that targets multiple muscle groups while improving cardiovascular fitness. The growing awareness of overall health and fitness has driven consumers to opt for rowing machines, especially as they are compact and can be easily stored in homes.
