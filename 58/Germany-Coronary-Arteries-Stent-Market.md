Drug-eluting stents are gaining significant traction due to their ability to release medication that helps prevent artery re-narrowing, reducing the need for repeat procedures. This feature has made DES a preferred option in the treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD), especially among patients with high-risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension. The increasing adoption of advanced DES technologies, including biodegradable and bioresorbable stents, is also contributing to the market's expansion. The demand for drug-eluting stents in Germany is fueled by their efficacy in reducing restenosis rates and improving long-term patient outcomes, making them a dominant choice in interventional cardiology.<p>On the other hand, bare-metal stents continue to maintain a portion of the market share, primarily due to their lower cost compared to drug-eluting stents. These stents are typically used in patients with lower risk of restenosis or those who are unable to tolerate the medication used in drug-eluting stents. While BMS have a higher rate of restenosis, their affordability and effectiveness in specific patient populations sustain their demand in the German healthcare system. Furthermore, bare-metal stents are preferred in emergency procedures where immediate cost considerations or lack of access to advanced stents may be a concern. As the market evolves, technological innovations in stent materials and design are expected to improve the outcomes of bare-metal s</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/687730/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Coronary Arteries Stent Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Coronary Arteries Stent Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Coronary Arteries Stent Market size was valued at USD 8.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 12.3 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.0% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Coronary Arteries Stent Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Medtronic</Li><Li> B.
