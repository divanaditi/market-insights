Solid doors, typically made of wood, steel, or composite materials, continue to dominate the market due to their durability, security, and aesthetic appeal. These doors offer excellent insulation and soundproofing properties, making them a popular choice for residential and commercial applications. Semi-solid doors, on the other hand, combine materials like wood with partial glass elements to enhance the visual appeal while still providing a level of security and privacy. Glass doors, often used in modern designs, offer a contemporary look while allowing natural light to enter the home, contributing to energy efficiency. The demand for each type varies according to the customer’s preferences for security, design, and functionality, which are influenced by evolving trends and technological advancements in the door manufacturing process.</p><p>Another key factor driving segmentation in the market is the increasing focus on energy-efficient solutions.
