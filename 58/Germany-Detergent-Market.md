Liquid detergents have seen substantial growth due to their convenience and effective cleaning power. Consumers often prefer liquid detergents for their ease of use, quick dissolving nature, and the ability to target stains directly. Additionally, liquid detergents are available in various formulations, catering to different laundry needs, such as sensitive skin or heavy-duty cleaning. As consumer demand shifts towards more practical and versatile products, the popularity of liquid detergents continues to rise in Germany, particularly in urban areas where convenience is prioritized. On the other hand, powder detergents, while still significant in the market, have seen a slight decline due to the growing preference for liquid alternatives. Powder detergents remain cost-effective and are often used for larger laundry loads or in industrial applications, where high-volume usage justifies the cost efficiency.<p>In addition to liquid and powder detergents, other types of cleaning products, such as pods, gel packs, and specialized detergents for delicate fabrics, are gaining popularity. Detergent pods offer an easy-to-use, pre-measured solution that reduces waste and ensures the right amount of detergent for each load. These products appeal to the growing trend of efficiency and sustainability. Gel packs, known for their concentrated cleaning formula, are favored for their ability to penetrate tough stains and offer targeted cleaning. Furthermore, niche products, such as detergents formulated for eco-conscious consumers, are becoming more prevalent. These products often feature biodegradable ingredients, lower environmental impact, and packaging that supports sustainability efforts.
