Wet pipe systems are the most commonly used, as they are simple, reliable, and efficient. These systems maintain water in the pipes under pressure, allowing immediate water discharge when a fire is detected. Dry pipe sprinklers, on the other hand, are employed in areas where freezing is a concern, as they keep the pipes dry until a fire triggers the release of air and the flow of water. Pre-action sprinklers combine elements of both wet and dry systems, offering added security against accidental water discharge. Deluge sprinklers are typically used in high-risk areas, releasing large volumes of water simultaneously to contain or extinguish fires rapidly. Each type serves a unique purpose depending on the specific requirements of the building or facility in which they are installed.</p><p>The choice of sprinkler type largely depends on factors such as environmental conditions, building design, and the level of fire risk present. Wet pipe systems are the most cost-effective and widely used due to their ease of installation and maintenance. Dry pipe systems are favored in cold environments or unheated areas, while pre-action and deluge systems find application in more specialized settings such as industrial plants or areas housing sensitive equipment.
