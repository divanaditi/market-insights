They are commonly used in various industries such as automotive, construction, and outdoor activities. The LED type also offers advanced features like adjustable brightness, rechargeable batteries, and compact designs, making them suitable for everyday carry and tactical purposes. On the other hand, incandescent flashlights, while being less energy-efficient compared to LED models, are still in demand due to their lower upfront cost and simplicity. These flashlights typically provide a softer light and are often used for personal, recreational, or emergency situations.
