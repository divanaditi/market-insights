Popular types of costumes include traditional outfits such as witches, vampires, and ghosts, which continue to dominate the market due to their timeless appeal. In addition, there is an increasing demand for pop culture-inspired costumes, such as characters from movies, TV shows, and video games. These costumes are especially popular among young adults and teenagers who seek to emulate their favorite fictional figures. Furthermore, the demand for humorous or pun-based costumes has grown in recent years, offering consumers a playful twist on the usual Halloween attire. These various costume types provide consumers with ample options to express creativity while enjoying the holiday celebrations.<p>Another significant segment in the market is the category of luxury or high-end costumes. These costumes, typically made with premium materials and intricate designs, are aimed at consumers willing to invest in unique and elaborate outfits.
