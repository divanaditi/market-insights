With rising concerns over skin irritation and allergies, baby wipes continue to maintain a strong market presence in Germany, driven by their formulation and convenience.<p>Another significant segment in the Germany sensitive skin wipe market is facial wipes. Designed to gently cleanse and hydrate the skin, these wipes are commonly used for removing makeup, dirt, and oil from the face. Facial wipes targeted at sensitive skin are manufactured with mild ingredients to prevent irritation. These products are gaining popularity due to their convenience, portability, and ability to offer an instant cleansing solution for on-the-go consumers.
