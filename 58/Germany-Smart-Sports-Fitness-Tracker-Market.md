They are particularly popular among individuals looking for a combination of fitness tracking and everyday wearability. Additionally, wrist-worn trackers are designed to be sleek and lightweight, making them an ideal choice for fitness enthusiasts who engage in both high-intensity sports and casual daily activities.
