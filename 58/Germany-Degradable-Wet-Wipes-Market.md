One major category includes biodegradable baby wipes, which are increasingly sought after due to growing environmental concerns. Parents and caregivers are prioritizing eco-friendly products that do not contribute to landfill waste. Biodegradable baby wipes are formulated using sustainable materials, offering a gentler alternative to traditional wet wipes that may contain harmful chemicals. As the demand for safe, non-toxic personal care products rises, this segment continues to gain significant traction in the German market, driven by the need for natural, skin-friendly wipes that decompose faster than conventional ones.</p><p>Another key segment in the market is the biodegradable personal care and household wipes. This includes wipes for general hygiene, face wipes, and surface cleaning wipes. Consumers are becoming increasingly conscious of environmental sustainability, prompting them to opt for wipes that break down more easily and do not contribute to the growing plastic waste crisis. As a result, many leading brands in Germany have developed wipes that are made with biodegradable fibers, ensuring that they are safe for both the user and the environment.
