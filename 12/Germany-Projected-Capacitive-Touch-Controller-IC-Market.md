Single-touch controller ICs dominate the market due to their cost-effectiveness and simplicity, making them suitable for basic applications that require minimal input functionality. These ICs are widely used in devices such as ATMs, point-of-sale systems, and basic touchscreen interfaces. The single-touch ICs are designed to detect a single point of contact and are commonly integrated into low-cost consumer electronics, where advanced touch functionality is not a primary requirement. The growing adoption of digital kiosks and self-service terminals has further fueled the demand for single-touch projected capacitive ICs, particularly in business and retail environments, where reliability and affordability are crucial.<p>On the other hand, multi-touch controller ICs are experiencing a significant rise in demand in the Germany market, driven by their ability to detect multiple simultaneous touch points. These ICs are integral to more advanced consumer electronics such as smartphones, tablets, and interactive displays.
