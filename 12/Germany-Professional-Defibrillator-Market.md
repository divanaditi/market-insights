External defibrillators, including automated external defibrillators (AEDs) and manual defibrillators, are the most commonly used devices in emergency settings. AEDs are designed for use by non-medical personnel in public spaces, while manual defibrillators require medical professionals for operation. These devices are gaining widespread adoption due to their ease of use and effectiveness in providing life-saving shocks in cases of cardiac arrest. AEDs are highly favored in locations such as airports, shopping malls, and workplaces, where quick access to defibrillation is critical. The growing demand for AEDs is also driven by increasing awareness regarding sudden cardiac arrest and the importance of immediate intervention, alongside advancements in device portability and user-friendly features.<p>Implantable defibrillators (ICDs), on the other hand, are typically used for patients at high risk of sudden cardiac arrest due to underlying heart conditions. ICDs are surgically implanted into the chest and continuously monitor the heart's rhythm, delivering shocks when abnormal patterns are detected. While external defibrillators are preferred in emergency situations, ICDs provide long-term prevention for individuals with chronic cardiovascular issues.
