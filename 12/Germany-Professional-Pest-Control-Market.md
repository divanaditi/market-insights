These types include insects, rodents, termites, and others. Insects, particularly ants, cockroaches, and bedbugs, dominate the market due to their widespread presence in both residential and commercial properties. Rodent control, focusing on rats and mice, follows closely as rodents are a persistent problem in urban and rural areas alike. The termite control segment is also significant, as these pests cause extensive damage to wooden structures and buildings, requiring specialized treatment. Each type of pest demands different control measures, such as chemical treatments, traps, baits, and natural solutions, making the market diverse in its service offerings. Increasing concerns over health risks and property damage are driving the demand for effective pest control solutions across these pest types in Germany.</p><p>The termite segment is expected to witness growth in the Germany professional pest control market due to the rising awareness of the long-term structural damage that termites can cause.
