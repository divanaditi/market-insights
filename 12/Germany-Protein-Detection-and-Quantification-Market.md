Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is one of the most popular techniques employed for protein quantification, owing to its high sensitivity and specificity. ELISA is widely used for detecting the presence of specific proteins in biological samples, making it crucial in research, diagnostics, and clinical applications. Another significant technique is mass spectrometry (MS), which provides accurate protein quantification and structural analysis. Mass spectrometry-based methods, including MALDI-TOF and LC-MS, are gaining popularity in the Germany market due to their precision and ability to analyze complex protein mixtures, making them valuable for proteomics research and biomarker discovery. These technologies are often used in combination to enhance the sensitivity and reliability of protein detection and quantification in various biological matrices.</p><p>Western blotting is another key method used in the protein detection and quantification market in Germany. This technique allows for the identification of specific proteins within a sample by separating proteins based on their size and subsequently detecting them using antibodies. Western blotting remains a trusted technique for validating protein expression levels in a variety of research settings, particularly in immunology and cell biology.
