The selective COX-2 inhibitors, which specifically target COX-2 enzymes, have gained popularity in recent years due to their effectiveness in reducing inflammation and pain with fewer gastrointestinal side effects compared to non-selective NSAIDs. These inhibitors are primarily used in the treatment of conditions like arthritis, acute pain, and dysmenorrhea. Among the available selective inhibitors, celecoxib has a significant market presence. These inhibitors have become a key component in the treatment of various inflammatory diseases, offering patients better tolerability and a safer alternative to traditional medications. With the rising awareness of side effects associated with non-selective NSAIDs, the selective COX-2 inhibitors segment is expected to continue its growth in the German market.</p><p>On the other hand, the non-selective COX inhibitors, which target both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, continue to dominate a significant portion of the COX-2 protein market. Non-selective NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and diclofenac, are commonly used for pain management and inflammation treatment due to their wide availability, affordability, and effectiveness. Despite their risk of gastrointestinal side effects, these medications remain a popular choice among healthcare providers, especially in cases where selective COX-2 inhibitors are not deemed necessary. The non-selective inhibitors segment benefits from their established market presence and low cost, making them an accessible treatment option for many patients in Germany. This segment is projected to maintain a steady share of the market, driven by demand in both over-the-counter and prescription drug categories, as</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/341136/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Prostaglandin-endoperoxide Synthase 2 (COX-2) Protein Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Prostaglandin-endoperoxide Synthase 2 (COX-2) Protein Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Prostaglandin-endoperoxide Synthase 2 (COX-2) Protein Market size was valued at USD 1.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.8 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 8.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Prostaglandin-endoperoxide Synthase 2 (COX-2) Protein Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Sino Biological</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> MyBiosource</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> Abbexa</Li><Li> LifeSpan BioSciences</Li><Li> Inc</Li><Li> Elabscience Biotechnology Inc.</Li><Li> â€‹â€‹Abcam</Li><Li> CUSABIO</Li><Li> Bio-Techne</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Prostaglandin-endoperoxide Synthase 2 (COX-2) Protein Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Prostaglandin-endoperoxide Synthase 2 (COX-2) Protein Market apart.
