Among these, cherries hold the largest share of the market, with both sweet and sour varieties being in high demand. These are popular for fresh consumption, as well as for the production of juices, jams, and desserts. The demand for plums is also significant, particularly for dried plums, which are often used in the food industry for processing into jams, sauces, and snacks. Furthermore, apricots, though less prevalent than cherries and plums, have a niche market due to their use in high-end confectionery and premium jams. This segmentation is driven by consumer preferences for fresh fruit consumption, as well as the expanding processed fruit sector in Germany.</p><p>The types of prunus in the German market also reflect trends in agriculture and climate adaptability. While cherries dominate in colder climates due to their resilience, plums are favored in regions with slightly warmer temperatures. Apricots, requiring more specific growing conditions, are mostly cultivated in southern regions of Germany. The diversification within prunus types also allows for year-round availability, with different varieties harvested at various times of the year, thereby ensuring continuous supply. This segmentation has contributed to a stable market, where each type plays a role in meeting specific consumer needs and preferences, ranging from fresh fruit sales to value-added processed products.
