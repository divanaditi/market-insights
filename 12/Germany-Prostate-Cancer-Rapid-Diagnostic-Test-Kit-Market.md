Biomarker-based tests are widely used for their ability to detect specific cancer-related proteins or markers in blood or urine samples. These tests provide a fast and non-invasive method to screen for prostate cancer, making them popular among healthcare providers and patients. They help in the early identification of potential prostate cancer cases, allowing for timely interventions. Additionally, these tests are often used in conjunction with other diagnostic methods to confirm the presence of cancer and assess its severity. Due to their accuracy and ease of use, biomarker-based tests are anticipated to continue dominating the market in the coming years. <p>Molecular diagnostics, on the other hand, involve the detection of genetic material from the cancer cells and provide a more detailed analysis of the disease. These tests offer insights into the genetic mutations or abnormalities that may lead to prostate cancer, aiding in personalized treatment plans. Although more complex and expensive than biomarker-based tests, molecular diagnostics offer higher precision and can detect early-stage cancers with greater sensitivity.
