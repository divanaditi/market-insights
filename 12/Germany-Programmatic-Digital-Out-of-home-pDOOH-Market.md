The digital transit segment includes displays in buses, trains, and subway stations, offering advertisers the advantage of targeting commuters and travelers in high-traffic environments. This segment is expected to grow due to the rise in mobile screen usage and location-based advertising technologies.</p><p>Digital place-based media covers displays in retail stores, shopping malls, airports, and other public spaces. These displays offer a unique opportunity for hyper-local targeting, delivering tailored ads based on real-time audience engagement.
