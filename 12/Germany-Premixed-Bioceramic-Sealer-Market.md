Among the prominent types are calcium silicate-based sealers, which are favored for their excellent biocompatibility and long-term performance in root canal sealing. These sealers are widely used due to their ability to promote tissue regeneration and provide a high resistance to bacterial infiltration. Additionally, calcium phosphate-based sealers are gaining popularity for their bioactive properties, which contribute to better bonding with dentin and enhancing the overall sealing quality. The increasing demand for these products is driven by their ability to offer superior sealing, reduced risk of re-infection, and better clinical outcomes in dental procedures. <p>Furthermore, another key segment within the market is epoxy resin-based bioceramic sealers. Known for their durability and optimal flow properties, these sealers are particularly effective in cases requiring minimal shrinkage and excellent apical sealing. They provide a robust solution for root canal obturation, ensuring a tight seal and long-lasting protection against microbial invasion. As the demand for minimally invasive dental treatments continues to rise, premixed bioceramic sealers are becoming more popular due to their ease of use, stability, and reduced procedural complications.
