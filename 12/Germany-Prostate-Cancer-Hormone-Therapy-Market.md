Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the most commonly used form of hormone therapy, as it aims to reduce or block the production of testosterone, which is known to fuel the growth of prostate cancer cells. ADT can be achieved through medications such as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists or antagonists, or through surgical methods like orchiectomy.

The widespread use of ADT in clinical practice is driven by its effectiveness in slowing disease progression and improving survival rates, making it the leading treatment option in the market.</p><p>Anti-androgens, on the other hand, work by blocking the action of testosterone on prostate cancer cells. Unlike ADT, which reduces testosterone levels, anti-androgens specifically target the androgen receptors, preventing the cancer cells from utilizing the available testosterone.
