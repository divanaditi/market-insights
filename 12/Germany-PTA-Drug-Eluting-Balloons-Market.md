Paclitaxel-eluting balloons have gained significant traction due to their effectiveness in preventing restenosis in peripheral arteries. These balloons are coated with paclitaxel, a drug that inhibits cell proliferation and reduces the risk of artery re-narrowing after angioplasty procedures. The growing adoption of paclitaxel-eluting balloons can be attributed to their proven efficacy in treating various vascular diseases, including peripheral artery disease (PAD). Additionally, their ability to improve long-term outcomes and reduce the need for repeat procedures is further driving market growth in Germany. As healthcare providers continue to focus on reducing complications and improving patient outcomes, the demand for paclitaxel-based DEBs is expected to rise steadily in the coming years.</p><p>Sirolimus-eluting balloons, another key type in the market, are gaining popularity due to their ability to provide sustained drug release and offer better restenosis prevention. Sirolimus, an immunosuppressive drug, works by preventing smooth muscle cell proliferation, which is a critical factor in the formation of restenosis. The sirolimus-eluting balloons are primarily used in the treatment of coronary and peripheral artery diseases, where restenosis is a major concern after angioplasty.
