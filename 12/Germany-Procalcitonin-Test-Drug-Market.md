The diagnostic segment includes procalcitonin tests used for the detection of bacterial infections, sepsis, and other inflammatory conditions. These tests are widely adopted in healthcare settings, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs), emergency departments, and hospitals, due to their ability to provide rapid and accurate results. Diagnostic kits for procalcitonin are available in various formats, including rapid tests, immunoassays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), which cater to different testing requirements based on patient conditions and clinical scenarios. Increasing demand for early diagnosis and personalized healthcare is driving the growth of this segment in the German market, as healthcare providers seek effective tools to manage infection-related complications more efficiently.</p><p>The therapeutic segment of the procalcitonin test drug market focuses on the use of procalcitonin levels to guide treatment decisions, particularly in antibiotic stewardship programs. Monitoring procalcitonin levels helps healthcare professionals determine the need for antibiotics, reducing unnecessary use and preventing antibiotic resistance. In Germany, the growing emphasis on precision medicine and the shift towards reducing healthcare-associated infections are key factors contributing to the growth of this segment.
