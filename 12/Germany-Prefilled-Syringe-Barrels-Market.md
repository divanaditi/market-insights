The glass prefilled syringe barrels dominate the market due to their excellent compatibility with a wide range of pharmaceutical formulations. Glass syringes offer high chemical resistance, making them ideal for containing biologics, vaccines, and other sensitive drugs. Their transparency also allows for easy visual inspection of the contents, which is crucial in clinical settings. Moreover, glass is inert, ensuring minimal interaction with the drug, thus maintaining the stability and effectiveness of the medication over time. As a result, glass prefilled syringe barrels are expected to retain their leading position in the market, supported by growing demand for injectable drug delivery systems across various therapeutic areas.<p>Plastic prefilled syringe barrels are another significant segment in the Germany market, benefiting from cost-effectiveness and lightweight characteristics. While glass syringes remain dominant, the plastic barrels offer distinct advantages, particularly in terms of convenience and reduced risk of breakage. Polypropylene, the most commonly used plastic material for prefilled syringe barrels, provides good chemical resistance and is suitable for a variety of drugs. The use of plastic barrels is gaining traction in applications where the risk of glass breakage is a concern or where cost considerations are important.
