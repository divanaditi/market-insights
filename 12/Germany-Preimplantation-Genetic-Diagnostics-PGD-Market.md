One significant type is the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), a widely used technique for detecting chromosomal abnormalities in embryos. FISH allows the identification of specific chromosomes, enabling the diagnosis of genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome and other chromosomal conditions. This technique is prevalent due to its ability to analyze multiple chromosomes simultaneously, providing efficient results. The demand for FISH in PGD is growing as it helps in enhancing pregnancy outcomes by selecting genetically healthy embryos, minimizing the risk of genetic diseases in offspring. FISH is especially useful for patients with a history of recurrent miscarriage or those undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (ART).</p><p>Another prominent segment in the market is the comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) technology. CGH is increasingly being adopted in PGD due to its capability to detect chromosomal imbalances such as deletions or duplications in embryos. This method offers a higher resolution compared to FISH, enabling a more detailed genetic analysis. CGH is particularly useful in diagnosing structural chromosomal abnormalit</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/345510/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Preimplantation Genetic Diagnostics (PGD) Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Preimplantation Genetic Diagnostics (PGD) Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Preimplantation Genetic Diagnostics (PGD) Market size was valued at USD 1.2 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.8 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 11.1% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Preimplantation Genetic Diagnostics (PGD) Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Illumina</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.</Li><Li> Agilent Technologies</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> Perkinelmer</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> Cooper Surgical</Li><Li> ABBott Laboratories</Li><Li> Natera</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> Rubicon Genomics</Li><Li> Oxford Gene Technology</Li><Li> Yikon Genomics</Li><Li> Scigene</Li><Li> Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI)</Li><Li> Genea Limited</Li><Li> Hamilton Thorne</Li><Li> FUJIFILM Irvine Scientific</Li><Li> Nidacon International</Li><Li> Vitrolife AB</Li><Li> Merck</Li><Li> INVO Bioscience</Li><Li> IVFtech</Li><Li> Gonagen Medikal</Li><Li> Cook Medical</Li><Li> CellCura</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Preimplantation Genetic Diagnostics (PGD) Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Preimplantation Genetic Diagnostics (PGD) Market apart.
