The first type includes monofocal IOLs, which are the most commonly used lenses in cataract surgery. These lenses are designed to provide a single focal point, typically for distance vision. Monofocal IOLs help improve clarity of vision for patients who require correction for nearsightedness or farsightedness. This type of IOL is widely preferred due to its simplicity, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. As the prevalence of cataract surgeries increases in Germany, the demand for monofocal lenses remains strong, especially among the aging population. The adoption of preloaded aspheric technology in monofocal lenses has further enhanced their performance, offering improved visual outcomes and faster recovery times for patients.</p><p>Another significant type in the market is multifocal IOLs, designed to provide patients with multiple focal points, enabling better vision at different distances. Multifocal lenses are increasingly preferred by patients who wish to reduce or eliminate their dependence on glasses or contact lenses after cataract surgery. In Germany, the growing aging population and higher demand for premium lens options have driven the growth of multifocal IOLs. These lenses are often more expensive than monofocal lenses but offer the advantage of enhanced quality of life for patients, as they support near, intermediate, and far vision. The development of advanced preloaded aspheric technology in multifocal lenses ensures improved visual clarity, reduced halos and glare, and better overall visual performance.
