Drug-eluting stents are designed to release a medication that helps prevent the artery from narrowing again after the procedure. This feature has led to a significant adoption of DES in the treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) in Germany. The demand for drug-eluting stents continues to rise due to their effectiveness in reducing restenosis rates compared to traditional bare-metal stents. Furthermore, advancements in drug-eluting technology, including improved biocompatibility and reduced risk of thrombosis, have reinforced their market position. The increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and growing preference for minimally invasive procedures further drive the uptake of drug-eluting stents across the country.</p><p>Bare-metal stents (BMS) represent another significant segment in the market, although their use is gradually declining in favor of drug-eluting stents. Bare-metal stents are primarily made from stainless steel and are considered simpler and more cost-effective compared to their drug-eluting counterparts. However, BMS come with a higher risk of restenosis, a factor that limits their widespread use in complex coronary interventions. Despite this, bare-metal stents continue to be an attractive option for patients who are not suitable candidates for drug-eluting stents, such as those with allergies to the drugs used or those at risk for excessive bleeding. The overall demand for bare-metal stents in Germany is expected to diminish slowly, but they remain relevant in specific clinical cases, maintaining a steady share in the overall market segment.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/469634/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Intraluminal Coronary Artery Stent Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Intraluminal Coronary Artery Stent Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Intraluminal Coronary Artery Stent Market size was valued at USD 7.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 11.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Intraluminal Coronary Artery Stent Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Abbott</Li><Li> B.Braun</Li><Li> Medtronic</Li><Li> Boston Scientific</Li><Li> Terumo</Li><Li> Lepu Medical</Li><Li> MicroPort</Li><Li> Biosensors</Li><Li> Atrium Medical</Li><Li> Biotronik</Li><Li> SINOMED</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Intraluminal Coronary Artery Stent Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Intraluminal Coronary Artery Stent Market apart.
