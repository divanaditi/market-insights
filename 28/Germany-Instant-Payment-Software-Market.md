This segment also includes solutions for handling cross-border instant payments, catering to the growing need for fast and cost-effective international money transfers. The rise of instant payments in the corporate sector is driven by the need for faster cash flow management and enhanced customer experience. Furthermore, Blockchain-based Instant Payment Software is emerging as a novel segment in the market, leveraging decentralized ledger technology for secure and transparent transactions.
