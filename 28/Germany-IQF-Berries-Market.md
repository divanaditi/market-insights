This segment is favored by food processors, manufacturers of smoothies, ice creams, and baked goods, as well as in the retail market. Other popular berry types in the market include raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries. As the demand for healthy, on-the-go snack options rises, these berries are also gaining traction for use in frozen food products like ready-to-eat meals and desserts. With the ongoing consumer preference for plant-based foods, IQF berries continue to experience increased adoption across diverse applications.<p>Raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries follow as significant contributors to the market, each offering unique taste profiles and nutritional benefits.
