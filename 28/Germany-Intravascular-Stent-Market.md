Bare-metal stents are traditional, stainless-steel mesh devices that help maintain arterial patency after balloon angioplasty. These stents are primarily used in patients with lower risk of restenosis and those who are less likely to benefit from drug-coated solutions. Despite their simplicity and cost-effectiveness, BMS have seen reduced adoption in recent years due to advancements in drug-eluting technologies. However, they still hold a significant share in less complex cases where drug-coated alternatives may not be necessary or optimal.<p>Drug-eluting stents, on the other hand, are coated with medication that helps reduce the risk of restenosis by preventing excessive tissue growth within the artery. These stents have revolutionized the treatment of coronary artery diseases by offering improved long-term outcomes. In Germany, DES dominate the market due to their ability to lower the chances of restenosis compared to BMS. With ongoing advancements in the formulation of drugs and stent materials, DES continue to see growing demand. These stents are particularly preferred for patients with complex lesions, diabetes, or other high-risk factors. The increasing focus on minimizing recurrence of blockages and enhancing patient outcomes continues to drive the adoption of drug-eluting stents in Germany's healthcare system.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/469416/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Intravascular Stent Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Intravascular Stent Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Intravascular Stent Market size was valued at USD 8.7 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 12.5 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 4.7% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Intravascular Stent Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Cordis</Li><Li> Boston Scientific</Li><Li> C.R.
