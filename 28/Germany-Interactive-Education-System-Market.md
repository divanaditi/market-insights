The hardware segment includes interactive whiteboards, smart tables, and touchscreens, which are widely adopted in schools and universities for creating a more engaging learning environment. These devices facilitate real-time interaction between students and teachers, enhancing the educational experience. The growing demand for digital classrooms and the increased focus on technology-based learning have fueled the adoption of these interactive hardware solutions. In particular, interactive whiteboards are gaining traction due to their ability to combine the traditional teaching methods with modern multimedia, enabling educators to deliver content in an immersive and dynamic manner.</p><p>On the other hand, the software segment plays a critical role in the development of interactive education systems in Germany. Software solutions include educational applications, learning management systems (LMS), and virtual classrooms that complement hardware technologies. These tools support personalized learning experiences and foster collaborative environments for both in-person and remote learners. As schools and universities increasingly embrace blended learning models, the demand for versatile, user-friendly educational software has surged.
