The quadrivalent vaccine targets four strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV), specifically types 6, 11, 16, and 18, which are responsible for the majority of cervical cancers and genital warts. This vaccine is widely used due to its efficacy in preventing HPV-related cancers and genital conditions. It has established a strong presence in the German market, largely due to its broad application for both males and females, as well as its relatively lower cost compared to newer alternatives.</p><p>The nonavalent vaccine, which targets nine strains of HPV, is a newer and more comprehensive option. It covers the same four strains as the quadrivalent vaccine while also including five additional high-risk strains. As the awareness around the importance of broader HPV protection increases, the nonavalent vaccine is gaining popularity in Germany, especially in preventive healthcare initiatives. Although the cost of the nonavalent vaccine is higher, its wider protection spectrum is making it a preferred choice for many healthcare providers and individuals seeking long-term protection against a broader range of HPV-related cancers.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/469620/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Intramuscular HPV Vaccine Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Intramuscular HPV Vaccine Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Intramuscular HPV Vaccine Market size was valued at USD 7.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 15.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 9.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Intramuscular HPV Vaccine Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD)</Li><Li> Pfizer</Li><Li> Sanofi</Li><Li> GSK</Li><Li> Serum Institute</Li><Li> Astellas Pharma</Li><Li> CSL</Li><Li> Emergent BioSolutions</Li><Li> GlaxoSmithKline</Li><Li> Johnson & Johnson</Li><Li> MedImmune</Li><Li> Walvax Biotechnology</Li><Li> Liaoning Chengda Biotechnology</Li><Li> Hualan Biological Engineering</Li><Li> Sinovac Biotech</Li><Li> Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products</Li><Li> Chang Chun High and New Technology Industries (Group)</Li><Li> Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise</Li><Li> Jiangsu Recbio Technology</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Intramuscular HPV Vaccine Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Intramuscular HPV Vaccine Market apart.
