Static AVRs are widely used in various industries due to their reliability and ability to provide precise voltage control. These systems use solid-state devices like thyristors to regulate voltage and are ideal for applications requiring stable and consistent voltage output. Static AVRs are commonly used in power generation, manufacturing plants, and large industrial facilities, where voltage stability is critical. They offer high efficiency and fast response times, making them a popular choice for modern electrical grids and sensitive equipment. The demand for static AVRs in Germany is expected to increase as industries continue to focus on energy efficiency and reliability, boosting their adoption in various sectors.<p>On the other hand, Dynamic AVRs are known for their ability to handle larger voltage fluctuations, making them suitable for more demanding environments, such as those found in power stations and heavy-duty industrial applications. These systems use rotating machines to regulate voltage and can provide better performance during sudden voltage surges or drops. Dynamic AVRs are preferred in situations where the electrical load is subject to frequent and large changes, as they can stabilize voltage quickly.
