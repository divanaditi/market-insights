Liquid egg whites are a significant product in the market due to their versatility and nutritional benefits, particularly in food processing and the health and fitness industry. They are widely used in baked goods, beverages, and sauces due to their ability to improve texture and consistency. Furthermore, liquid egg whites are an excellent source of protein with low fat and cholesterol content, making them highly demanded by health-conscious consumers. The increasing demand for protein-rich foods has contributed to the growth of this segment, especially in Germany, where consumers are increasingly prioritizing health and wellness in their dietary choices.<p>On the other hand, liquid egg yolks have gained prominence in the market due to their essential role in a variety of food products, including mayonnaise, salad dressings, and ice cream. Egg yolks are rich in nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and fats, which enhance the flavor and texture of various processed foods. The demand for liquid egg yolks has been driven by the growing popularity of convenience foods and ready-to-eat meals, which use egg yolks as a key ingredient. Additionally, liquid egg yolks are favored in the food industry for their ability to create stable emulsions, a crucial component in many food products.
