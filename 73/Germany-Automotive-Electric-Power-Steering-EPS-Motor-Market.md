Column-type motors are integrated into the steering column and are known for their compact design and direct power assistance to the steering wheel. These motors are commonly used in small to mid-sized vehicles due to their space-saving features and cost-effectiveness. They are ideal for providing a smooth and responsive steering feel, particularly in urban environments where maneuverability is a priority. This type of EPS motor is increasingly being adopted in the market due to advancements in motor control systems, leading to improved efficiency and reduced energy consumption. The growing demand for fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly vehicles is further driving the growth of column-type motors in the automotive sector.<p>On the other hand, rack-type motors are typically integrated into the vehicle’s steering rack and provide more direct power assistance to the wheels. These motors offer superior performance, especially in larger vehicles such as SUVs and luxury cars, due to their ability to deliver higher torque. Rack-type EPS motors are known for their greater precision and handling capabilities, making them ideal for high-performance vehicles and those requiring enhanced steering response at higher speeds. The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid vehicles in Germany is also contributing to the growth of rack-type motors, as they are crucial for enhancing the overall driving experience while optimizing energy usage. With ongoing advancements in electric motor technology, rack-type EPS motors continue to evolve, providing a more efficient and reliable option for modern automotive applications.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/807806/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Automotive Electric Power Steering (EPS) Motor Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Automotive Electric Power Steering (EPS) Motor Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Automotive Electric Power Steering (EPS) Motor Market size was valued at USD 3.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 5.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.4% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Automotive Electric Power Steering (EPS) Motor Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Key Player I</Li><Li> Key Player II</Li><Li> Key Player III</Li><Li> Key Player IV</Li><Li> Key Player V</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Automotive Electric Power Steering (EPS) Motor Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Automotive Electric Power Steering (EPS) Motor Market apart.
