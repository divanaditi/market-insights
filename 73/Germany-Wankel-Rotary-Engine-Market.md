Single-rotor engines are widely utilized for applications that require compact and lightweight engines, providing superior power-to-weight ratios. These engines are typically used in smaller vehicles, such as motorcycles and compact cars, due to their efficiency and compact design. The twin-rotor engine, on the other hand, has found popularity in both automotive and aerospace applications, offering better performance and durability compared to single-rotor engines. Twin-rotor engines balance power output and size, making them a versatile option in the German market for high-performance vehicles. Multiple-rotor engines are more niche, offering substantial power for specialized applications, such as aviation or high-performance racing cars, though their use remains limited compared to single and twin-rotor types in mainstream markets.</p><p>In terms of market demand, the twin-rotor engine dominates the Wankel rotary engine sector due to its ability to cater to both power and efficiency needs. This type is commonly employed in sports cars and other performance-oriented vehicles, making it highly sought after in the automotive market. The demand for single-rotor engines, while smaller, is expected to grow steadily, driven by increasing adoption in electric vehicle development, where they can serve as range-extender engines. Multiple-rotor engines are primarily reserved for high-performance racing and aviation, with applications in drones and aircraft gaining momentum. Although less common, these engines are expected to see incremental growth as innovation in aerospace and high-performance sectors continues.
