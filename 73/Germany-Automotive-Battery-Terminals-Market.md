Lead battery terminals have been the traditional choice for automotive batteries due to their cost-effectiveness and reliability. They are extensively used in conventional internal combustion engine vehicles, offering a stable connection to the battery. Lead terminals are highly durable and resistant to corrosion, making them ideal for high-temperature environments, which is essential for automotive applications. Furthermore, their widespread use in the automotive industry has led to a well-established supply chain for lead-based terminals, which maintains their dominant market share. As vehicles in Germany continue to rely heavily on traditional engine systems, lead battery terminals are expected to remain a key product in the market for the foreseeable future.</p><p>On the other hand, lithium battery terminals are gaining traction in the automotive sector, driven by the growing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). Lithium-ion batteries, known for their high energy density and lightweight properties, are becoming the preferred power source for EVs due to their efficiency.
