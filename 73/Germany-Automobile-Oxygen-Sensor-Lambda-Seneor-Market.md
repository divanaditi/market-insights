Planar oxygen sensors are widely used in modern vehicles due to their compact design and high efficiency. These sensors are typically integrated into the exhaust system and monitor the oxygen levels in the exhaust gases to optimize engine performance and reduce emissions. Their rapid response time and improved accuracy make them popular in contemporary vehicle applications, particularly in advanced emission control systems. On the other hand, cylindrical oxygen sensors, though less commonly used in newer vehicle models, still maintain a significant share in the market. They feature a more traditional design with a larger size, offering reliable oxygen measurement capabilities in older vehicle models or specialized applications where space is not a constraint.</p><p>Both types of sensors play a crucial role in maintaining vehicle fuel efficiency and ensuring compliance with stringent emission regulations in Germany. The demand for planar oxygen sensors is expected to grow significantly as automakers continue to adopt more advanced technologies for reducing carbon emissions. Furthermore, the development of sensor materials and coating technologies is enhancing the overall performance of both planar and cylindrical oxygen sensors, contributing to the market's expansion.
