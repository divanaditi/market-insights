Stationary machines are widely used in airports, government buildings, and large-scale commercial establishments where continuous security screening is necessary. These machines offer high-resolution imaging capabilities, allowing for the detection of a wide range of threats such as explosives, weapons, and contraband. Stationary machines are typically larger in size and designed to accommodate high throughput, ensuring effective security at high-traffic locations. Additionally, they are often integrated with advanced software for real-time image analysis and threat identification. The growing need for enhanced security in public spaces has led to the widespread adoption of these stationary machines across various sectors, from transportation to critical infrastructure protection.<p>On the other hand, portable X-ray security machines are becoming increasingly popular due to their flexibility and ease of use in different environments. These machines are lightweight and designed for mobile use, making them ideal for law enforcement agencies, military operations, and emergency response teams. Portable X-ray machines provide on-the-spot security checks in areas that may not have the infrastructure for stationary systems. With advancements in technology, these portable devices are now capable of delivering high-quality imaging and detecting a range of concealed items.
