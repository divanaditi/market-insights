Engine components, including pistons, crankshafts, and camshafts, hold a major share of the market due to their critical role in vehicle performance. Suspension systems such as shock absorbers, struts, and springs are also essential for ensuring vehicle stability and comfort, driving demand in the market. Transmission components, including gearboxes and clutches, contribute significantly as they are vital for efficient power transfer and optimal vehicle operation. Electrical and electronic systems like batteries, alternators, and sensors are increasingly important, driven by the growing demand for electric vehicles and enhanced vehicle safety features. Body parts such as bumpers, doors, and windows also remain in high demand as a result of vehicle maintenance and repair needs.<p>The second key category in the Germany automobile parts market is related to aftermarket parts, which include replacement, repair, and maintenance components. These parts are essential for vehicle longevity and performance, as they are used for repairs and upgrades after the initial vehicle purchase. The demand for aftermarket parts is fueled by the large number of vehicles on the road, as well as consumer preferences for cost-effective replacements over OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) parts. Furthermore, the rise in DIY car repairs and the expanding network of independent service providers is driving growth in this segment. Another important type is tires, which are crucial for vehicle safety, fuel efficiency, and driving performance.
