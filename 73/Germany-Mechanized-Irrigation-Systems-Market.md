Center pivot irrigation systems are widely used due to their ability to cover large areas efficiently. These systems are ideal for agricultural fields with rectangular or circular layouts. The center pivot system's popularity is driven by its high water efficiency and automation, making it suitable for various crops, including cereals, vegetables, and fruits. Lateral move systems, on the other hand, are typically used in areas where water supply is limited, offering an alternative to traditional sprinkler systems. These systems move laterally across the field, ensuring consistent water distribution for crops, and are particularly effective for row crops like maize and wheat. Drip irrigation systems are gaining traction due to their water conservation capabilities, especially in regions experiencing water scarcity. <p>The drip irrigation segment has witnessed significant growth in recent years, as it delivers water directly to plant roots, reducing water wastage and ensuring precise moisture levels for different crops. This system is ideal for high-value crops, such as fruits, vegetables, and vineyards, which require specific irrigation schedules. Additionally, advancements in technology have led to the development of more efficient and cost-effective drip irrigation solutions, further boosting their adoption in Germany.
