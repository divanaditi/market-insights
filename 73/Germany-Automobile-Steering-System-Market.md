Manual steering systems, though becoming less common, are still used in smaller, older vehicles due to their cost-effectiveness and simplicity. Power steering systems, including hydraulic and electric power steering, are more commonly used in modern vehicles, providing drivers with ease of handling and reduced effort when turning the steering wheel. Hydraulic power steering (HPS) uses a fluid pump to assist steering, while electric power steering (EPS) uses electric motors to provide assistance, making it more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. The growing demand for fuel-efficient and lightweight vehicles is driving the shift toward EPS in the German market.</p><p>Electronic steering systems, such as steer-by-wire systems, represent the most advanced segment, offering a more sophisticated and customizable driving experience. These systems eliminate the need for physical linkages between the steering wheel and the wheels, using electrical signals instead. This innovation allows for improved vehicle design, as the steering mechanism can be placed anywhere within the cabin, providing greater flexibility in car interiors.
