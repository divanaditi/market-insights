One of the primary segments is the saturated coconut alkanes, which are derived from the hydrogenation of coconut oil. These alkanes are predominantly used in cosmetic and personal care products, such as moisturizers, shampoos, and conditioners, owing to their skin-conditioning and emollient properties. They are also employed in various industrial applications where low toxicity and high stability are required. Saturated coconut alkanes are known for their ability to offer a non-greasy and lightweight feel, making them highly preferred for consumer goods in Germany.  Another key segment in the coconut alkanes market is the unsaturated coconut alkanes.
