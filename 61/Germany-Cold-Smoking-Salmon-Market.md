Traditional cold smoked salmon is the most widely consumed product, known for its delicate texture and rich flavor, which is achieved through the smoking process at low temperatures. This type of salmon is typically enjoyed as a premium product in various culinary applications, including sandwiches, salads, and appetizers. As consumers increasingly seek high-quality, sustainable seafood options, traditional cold smoked salmon remains the dominant segment in the German market, appealing to both local and international consumers who value authentic taste and craftsmanship in their seafood products.</p><p>On the other hand, flavored cold smoked salmon is gaining popularity as a versatile product offering unique taste profiles. This category includes salmon varieties that are infused with various seasonings, herbs, and spices such as dill, lemon, garlic, or even exotic flavors like honey and chili. The rise in consumer preference for novel, bold flavors has fueled the demand for flavored cold smoked salmon, especially among younger demographics seeking adventurous and premium products.
