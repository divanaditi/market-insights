Among the most popular varieties, citrus-based juices, such as orange and lemon, dominate the market due to their refreshing taste and high demand in both households and the foodservice industry. These juices are favored for their high vitamin C content and are commonly consumed as a health-boosting option. Additionally, apple-based cold-pressed juices are highly popular, offering a sweet and mild flavor that appeals to a broad range of consumers. Other fruit-based cold pressed juices, such as those from berries, pineapples, and pomegranates, are also gaining traction for their unique flavors and perceived health benefits, including antioxidant properties and natural sweetness without added sugars. These juices cater to consumers seeking both indulgence and nutrition in their beverages.</p><p>Another significant segment in the cold-pressed juice market in Germany includes vegetable-based juices, often blended with fruits to enhance flavor and nutrition. Carrot, beetroot, and celery juices are among the top contenders in this category, offering distinct health advantages such as improving skin health, boosting energy levels, and supporting digestive health. These juices appeal to health-conscious consumers, including those following vegan, vegetarian, or detox diets. Additionally, green juices, made from a combination of leafy vegetables like kale and spinach with fruits, are increasingly popular due to their nutrient-dense content. The demand for organic cold pressed juices is also rising, as consumers in Germany are becoming more conscious of the environmental and health impacts of their food choices.
