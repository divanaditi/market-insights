Input devices, such as keyboards, mice, and trackpads, dominate the market due to their essential role in user interaction with PCs. Keyboards and mice, in particular, are crucial for both personal and professional computing environments, driving high demand across various sectors. Additionally, gaming peripherals, like specialized gaming keyboards and mice, are gaining popularity, catering to the growing gaming community in Germany. Storage devices, including external hard drives, SSDs, and USB flash drives, are another significant segment, driven by the need for enhanced data storage solutions and data security. These devices offer portable and high-capacity storage options, which are highly sought after in the digital age for both personal and business use.</p><p>Output devices, such as monitors, printers, and speakers, are also key players in the market.
