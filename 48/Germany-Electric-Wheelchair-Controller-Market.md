These controllers offer a higher degree of personalization, allowing users to adjust the speed, acceleration, and other parameters according to their specific needs. The demand for these controllers is increasing as they cater to a broader range of medical conditions and disabilities, offering a more tailored experience. In the Germany market, these types of controllers are gaining traction due to their ability to enhance the quality of life for users with more complex needs.
