Disinfectant wipes are highly convenient and effective in cleaning surfaces quickly, making them a popular choice in both consumer and professional sectors. The demand for such products has grown with the increased emphasis on health and safety. Specialty disinfectants, formulated for specific purposes like medical environments or industrial settings, are also gaining prominence due to their targeted effectiveness. These products cater to the stringent requirements of sectors that handle sensitive equipment and environments.
