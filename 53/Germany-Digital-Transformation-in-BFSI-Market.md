The market is segmented by type into two main categories: digital banking solutions and digital insurance solutions. Digital banking solutions have gained significant traction as consumers increasingly demand seamless, user-friendly platforms for financial transactions.

Additionally, digital tools are transforming customer interactions by offering easy access to policy management, renewals, and claims, improving the overall customer journey.
