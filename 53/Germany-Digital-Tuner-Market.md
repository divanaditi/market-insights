They cater to a niche segment but are growing in demand due to the increasing number of digital content creators and users who prefer using their PCs for media consumption. Additionally, portable digital tuners are another rising segment, appealing to on-the-go consumers. These compact devices offer flexibility, allowing users to enjoy digital broadcasts on mobile devices, such as laptops, tablets, or even smartphones.
