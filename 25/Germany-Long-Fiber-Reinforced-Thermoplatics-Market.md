GF-LFRT is the dominant segment in the country due to its excellent mechanical properties, such as high strength and rigidity, coupled with its cost-effectiveness compared to carbon fiber alternatives. Glass fiber reinforced thermoplastics are widely used in industries like automotive, aerospace, and construction for their ability to withstand harsh conditions while maintaining lightweight characteristics. The demand for GF-LFRT is also driven by its recyclability and ease of processing, which align with the growing focus on sustainability in the manufacturing sector. These attributes make it a preferred choice for a broad range of applications, from exterior body parts to structural components in vehicles and machinery.</p><p>On the other hand, carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics (CF-LFRT) are gaining traction in the German market due to their superior strength-to-weight ratio and exceptional stiffness, making them suitable for high-performance applications. CF-LFRT is primarily used in automotive sectors, particularly in electric vehicles (EVs) and lightweight vehicle construction, where reducing weight is critical to improving energy efficiency. While more expensive than glass fiber, the benefits of CF-LFRT in terms of durability, thermal stability, and resistance to corrosion justify the higher cost in premium and high-end applications. The increasing adoption of CF-LFRT in industries like automotive, aerospace, and sports equipment is expected to drive its market growth.
