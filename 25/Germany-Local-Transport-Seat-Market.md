One key category is the standard seat, which is commonly found in buses, trams, and trains. These seats are designed for comfort during short and medium commutes and are made from durable materials that can withstand frequent use. They often feature fabric or synthetic covers and are generally unpadded or minimally cushioned. Standard seats focus on maximizing space and accommodating a large number of passengers.
