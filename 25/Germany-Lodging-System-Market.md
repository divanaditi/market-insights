The shift toward more diverse lodging types is fueled by the growing preference for self-catering, extended stays, and unique accommodations that align with specific traveler needs. Meanwhile, the demand for hostels continues to thrive, particularly among youth and backpacker demographics, drawn by the affordability and community-oriented environments they offer.
