This segment includes a wide range of flavors, such as strawberry, mango, and raspberry, offering a lighter, fruity alternative to the classic creamy ice cream. Additionally, dairy-based low fat ice creams are commonly available, offering a familiar taste but with reduced fat content. These products often incorporate ingredients like yogurt or milk, providing a creamy texture without the added fat, appealing to consumers who are health-conscious but still desire the traditional flavor of ice cream.</p><p>Another growing segment within the market is plant-based low fat ice cream.
