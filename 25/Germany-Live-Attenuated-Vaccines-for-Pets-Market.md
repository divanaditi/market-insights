One of the most widely used categories includes vaccines designed for dogs, which protect against several viral infections such as canine distemper, parvovirus, and adenovirus. These vaccines are developed using weakened strains of the virus, providing long-lasting immunity with fewer side effects. Additionally, vaccines for cats, such as those for feline distemper and calicivirus, are also prominent in the market. These vaccines are crucial for maintaining the health of domestic pets and are routinely administered by veterinarians as part of a standard vaccination schedule.</p><p>Another important segment in the market focuses on vaccines for exotic pets, such as rabbits, guinea pigs, and ferrets. Though the demand for these vaccines is relatively smaller compared to those for dogs and cats, they still play a significant role in preventing specific infections in these animals. The development of vaccines for exotic pets requires special consideration due to their unique immune systems and biological needs.
