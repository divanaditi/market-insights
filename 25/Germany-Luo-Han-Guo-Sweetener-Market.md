This form of the sweetener is typically used in packaged snacks, baked goods, and dietary supplements, making it a popular choice in the health-conscious consumer segment. Additionally, the stability and long shelf-life of powdered sweeteners contribute to their widespread adoption in the market.</p><p>On the other hand, the liquid segment is gaining traction in the Germany market, particularly among consumers looking for convenient, ready-to-use sweetener options.
