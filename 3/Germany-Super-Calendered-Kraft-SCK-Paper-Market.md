Unbleached SCK paper is often preferred for industrial and packaging applications due to its natural strength, durability, and sustainability. This type of paper is typically used in manufacturing corrugated packaging, bags, and wrapping materials. It offers excellent resistance to tearing, making it ideal for heavy-duty applications. Unbleached SCK paper is also favored in industries focused on eco-friendly solutions as it requires minimal chemical processing, thus reducing its environmental footprint. The demand for unbleached SCK paper is particularly high in the packaging sector, where performance and sustainability are crucial considerations.<p>On the other hand, bleached SCK paper is treated to achieve a cleaner, whiter appearance, making it suitable for high-end packaging, printing, and promotional materials.

This type of SCK paper is widely used in the production of luxury packaging, labels, and retail packaging, where aesthetics are a key factor. Bleached SCK paper also offers better printability, which is a significant advantage for businesses in the marketing and branding sectors.
