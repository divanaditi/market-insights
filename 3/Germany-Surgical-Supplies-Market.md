Surgical drapes, which provide sterile barriers during surgery, also play a key role in infection control and are widely utilized in German healthcare facilities. Additionally, wound care products, including bandages, dressings, and gauze, form a crucial segment, as they are necessary for post-surgical care and patient recovery, driving their demand in the market.</p><p>Another prominent segment in the Germany surgical supplies market is the surgical sutures and staples category.
