Raw shelled shrimp is the more popular category due to its versatility in various cuisines, especially in seafood dishes where freshness is crucial. These shrimp are typically preferred by consumers who desire to cook them to their preferred level of doneness. Additionally, raw shelled shrimp often offers greater opportunities for processing, as it can be used in a wide range of products, such as shrimp cocktails or added to salads and stir-fries. As a result, the demand for raw shelled shrimp remains high in both the retail and food service sectors, particularly among consumers seeking high-quality, fresh seafood options. This category's growth is driven by the increasing consumer interest in premium seafood products and the expansion of global culinary influences.<p>On the other hand, cooked shelled shrimp has seen significant growth as well, mainly due to its convenience factor. These shrimp are pre-cooked and ready for immediate consumption, making them a popular choice among busy consumers and foodservice businesses. The ease of use of cooked shelled shrimp caters to the growing demand for quick, hassle-free meal options, especially in the ready-to-eat segment. Additionally, cooked shelled shrimp are often used in prepared meals, salads, sandwiches, and various appetizers, further driving their market presence. While raw shelled shrimp dominates in terms of volume, the cooked variety is expected to experience steady growth as the demand for convenience foods continues to rise in Germany. The increasing popularity of meal kits and ready-to-eat meals also contributes to the upward trend of the cooked shelled shrimp segment, catering to modern consumer lifestyles.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/742316/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Shelled Shrimp Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Shelled Shrimp Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Shelled Shrimp Market size was valued at USD 10.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 15.0 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 4.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Shelled Shrimp Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Minh Phu Seafood Corp</Li><Li> Thai Union</Li><Li> Expalsa</Li><Li> Zhanjiang Guolian</Li><Li> Pescanova</Li><Li> Songa</Li><Li> Iberconsa</Li><Li> Conarpesa</Li><Li> Royal Greenland A/S</Li><Li> ProExpo</Li><Li> Minh Phu Seafood Corp</Li><Li> Devi Fisheries</Li><Li> Nekkanti Sea Foods</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Shelled Shrimp Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Shelled Shrimp Market apart.
