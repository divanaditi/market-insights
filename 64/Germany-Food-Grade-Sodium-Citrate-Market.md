Anhydrous sodium citrate is a dehydrated form of sodium citrate that offers a longer shelf life and more concentrated form. This type is preferred for applications requiring high stability and effectiveness in food and beverage products, such as in the production of beverages, processed cheese, and as a buffering agent. Its ability to maintain a stable pH and improve texture in various products is a significant factor driving its demand in the market.</p><p>On the other hand, dihydrate sodium citrate contains water molecules within its crystal structure and is typically used in the food industry where the presence of water does not affect product quality. Dihydrate sodium citrate is widely utilized in applications like candy making, dairy products, and as an emulsifying salt in cheese manufacturing. The choice between anhydrous and dihydrate forms depends largely on the specific formulation requirements of food products, with dihydrate being more suitable for recipes where water content is a factor.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/741284/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Food Grade Sodium Citrate Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Food Grade Sodium Citrate Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Food Grade Sodium Citrate Market size was valued at USD 1.20 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 1.85 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.3% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Food Grade Sodium Citrate Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM)</Li><Li> Cargill IncrporatedATP Group</Li><Li> Gadot Biochemical Industries LTD</Li><Li> Pan Chem Corporation</Li><Li> S.A.
