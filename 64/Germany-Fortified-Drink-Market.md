Vitamins such as vitamin C, vitamin D, and various antioxidants are commonly added to fortified juices, making them popular in the wellness sector. Another prominent type is fortified water, designed to offer hydration along with added benefits like electrolytes, vitamins, or minerals, thus making it a favored choice among active individuals and fitness enthusiasts. These products are gaining traction due to their convenience and health-conscious appeal. In addition, fortified dairy drinks such as milk and yogurt drinks also contribute significantly to the market by offering calcium and other essential nutrients for bone health and overall wellness.</p><p>Plant-based fortified drinks have also experienced significant growth in the German market, driven by the increasing demand for vegan and lactose-free alternatives.
