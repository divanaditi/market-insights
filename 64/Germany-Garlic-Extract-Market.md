Liquid garlic extract holds a significant share of the market due to its versatility in both culinary and medicinal applications. It is preferred for its ease of use and ability to retain the active compounds of garlic, such as allicin, which offer health benefits like enhanced immunity and cardiovascular support. The liquid form is also widely used in supplements and functional foods, contributing to its dominance in the market. Additionally, liquid garlic extract is increasingly utilized in the cosmetic industry due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>On the other hand, powdered garlic extract is gaining traction due to its longer shelf life, convenience, and high concentration of active ingredients. It is commonly used in dietary supplements, herbal products, and as a flavoring agent in processed foods. The powdered form allows for easier dosage and is often preferred for its stability in various formulations. As consumer demand for convenient, health-boosting products continues to rise, powdered garlic extract is expected to witness steady growth in the German market, offering both nutritional and functional benefits.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/735732/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Garlic Extract Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Garlic Extract Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Garlic Extract Market size was valued at USD 4.2 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 7.8 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 8.4% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Garlic Extract Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Woolworths Limited</Li><Li> Dabur</Li><Li> Now Foods</Li><Li> Mars</Li><Li> Incrporated</Li><Li> Nilon's</Li><Li> Ever Organic</Li><Li> Allicin Pharm</Li><Li> Kelpak</Li><Li> Wuxi Cima Science Co.</Li><Li>Ltd</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Garlic Extract Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Garlic Extract Market apart.
