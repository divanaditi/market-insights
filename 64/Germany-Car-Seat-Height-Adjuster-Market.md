The demand for manual adjusters is driven by their ease of use and low maintenance requirements, making them a popular choice among budget-conscious consumers. Additionally, the simplicity of these adjusters ensures long-lasting durability, further contributing to their widespread adoption in the German automotive market.</p><p>On the other hand, power seat height adjusters are gaining traction in the premium vehicle segment, offering greater convenience and precision. These adjusters use electrical motors to allow seamless height adjustments with the push of a button, providing a more comfortable and personalized driving experience. Power seat height adjusters are typically incorporated in luxury cars, where the emphasis is on comfort and advanced features. Their popularity is fueled by the growing consumer preference for technology-driven solutions and the increasing integration of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in high-end vehicles.
