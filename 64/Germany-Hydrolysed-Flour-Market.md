It is also popular in the production of processed meat and savory snacks. Additionally, it is favored for its high nutritional content, which makes it a preferred ingredient in health-focused food products. The continuous innovation in wheat hydrolysed flour production techniques further drives its demand in various industrial applications, catering to both traditional and modern consumer needs. As the German market continues to prioritize healthier and more sustainable food options, wheat hydrolysed flour plays a vital role in meeting these evolving demands.</p><p>Another important segment in the Germany hydrolysed flour market is corn hydrolysed flour, which is increasingly gaining traction due to its functional properties and cost-effectiveness.
