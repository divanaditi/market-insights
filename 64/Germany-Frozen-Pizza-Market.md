One of the major categories is traditional frozen pizza, which includes popular varieties such as Margherita, Pepperoni, and Four Cheese. These pizzas are typically made with classic ingredients and are designed to appeal to a broad audience who seek convenience and familiar tastes. Additionally, gourmet frozen pizzas are gaining traction, featuring higher-quality ingredients and more unique combinations, such as truffle oil, exotic cheeses, or organic toppings. This segment caters to consumers looking for more premium and flavorful options, further expanding the market's diversity.</p><p>Another notable segment is the healthy or specialty frozen pizza category, which includes gluten-free, vegan, and low-calorie options. As consumer health consciousness grows, more people are opting for pizzas that fit into specific dietary preferences or restrictions. Gluten-free pizzas, made with alternative crusts like rice or corn flour, are becoming increasingly popular, as are vegan pizzas that replace traditional cheese with plant-based alternatives.
