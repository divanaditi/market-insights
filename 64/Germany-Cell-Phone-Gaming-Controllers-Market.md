Clip-on controllers are popular due to their portability and ease of use, offering a physical gaming experience that mimics traditional game consoles. These controllers typically feature customizable buttons and triggers, which allow for precise control during gameplay. The Bluetooth controllers, on the other hand, provide a wider range of compatibility with different mobile devices and are favored for their ergonomic design and wireless functionality.
