Serological tests hold a significant share of the market, as they are the first-line diagnostic method for detecting celiac disease. These tests typically measure specific antibodies, such as anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA), which are elevated in individuals with celiac disease. Due to their high sensitivity and non-invasive nature, serological tests are widely preferred in initial diagnosis. Furthermore, advancements in diagnostic kits and test accuracy are likely to fuel the growth of serological testing in the coming years, strengthening its position in the market.<p>Genetic testing is another essential segment in the market, used to assess the presence of HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 genes, which are commonly associated with celiac disease. While genetic tests are not diagnostic on their own, they serve as an important adjunct in confirming the disease, particularly when other test results are inconclusive. Biopsy-based diagnostics, including small bowel biopsy, remain the gold standard for definitive diagnosis, though their invasiveness and procedural complexity limit their widespread use. As technology progresses, more precise, less invasive methods for diagnosis are expected to emerge, influencing the market dynamics and expanding the range of testing options available to healthcare providers and patients.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/737670/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Celiac Disease Diagnostics Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Celiac Disease Diagnostics Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Celiac Disease Diagnostics Market size was valued at USD 0.95 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 1.59 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.1% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Celiac Disease Diagnostics Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.</Li><Li> PRIMA Lab SA</Li><Li> Glutenostics</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> NanoRepro AG.</Li><Li> Targeted Genomics</Li><Li> YORKTEST Laboratories</Li><Li> Biohit Oyj</Li><Li> Labsystems Diagnostics Oy</Li><Li> RxHome Test</Li><Li> Biomerica</Li><Li> AESKU.GROUP GmbH</Li><Li> LaCAR MDx Technologies</Li><Li> J.
