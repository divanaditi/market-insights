One of the major categories is time tracking software, which helps organizations accurately monitor the working hours of employees. This type of software is widely used to manage payroll, calculate overtime, and ensure compliance with labor regulations. Another prominent segment includes expense management software, designed to streamline the process of recording and managing business expenses. It aids businesses in tracking and controlling spending, ensuring cost efficiency, and simplifying the reimbursement process for employees. Both these types of software are essential in enhancing operational productivity, providing transparency, and enabling better financial decision-making within organizations.<p>Additionally, integrated solutions that combine both time tracking and expense management functionalities are gaining traction in the market.
