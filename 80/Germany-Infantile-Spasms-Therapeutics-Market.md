Drug-based treatments dominate the market, with anticonvulsant medications such as vigabatrin and corticosteroids being the most commonly prescribed. Vigabatrin, approved for use in infants with infantile spasms, is considered one of the first-line therapies, and its efficacy in treating seizures contributes to its widespread use. Corticosteroids, particularly ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), are also frequently utilized to reduce spasms and inflammation in the brain. These medications help manage the condition by targeting underlying neurological processes. Drug-based treatments have shown significant success, but they come with potential side effects, such as weight gain and potential long-term neurological impacts, which drive the development of alternative non-drug therapies. The continuous advancement in drug formulations and treatment regimens is expected to support growth in this segment.</p><p>Non-drug-based treatments are gaining traction as an alternative or complementary approach to managing infantile spasms. These therapies include surgical interventions, such as the implantation of a vagus nerve stimulator (VNS), and specialized diets like the ketogenic diet, which has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing seizures. The ketogenic diet, which is high in fats and low in carbohydrates, helps to modify the brain's metabolism, potentially reducing seizure activity in children with infantile spasms. VNS, which involves implanting a device to send electrical signals to the brain, has shown promise in cases where drugs are ineffective or have intolerable side effects. As awareness grows about the side effects and limitations of drug-based treatments, the market for non-drug therapies is expected to grow, providing patients with alternative options for managing infantile spasms. Research into improving these non-pharmacological treatments is ongoing, further increasing their potential in the German market.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/863988/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Infantile Spasms Therapeutics Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Infantile Spasms Therapeutics Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Infantile Spasms Therapeutics Market size was valued at USD 0.70 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 1.50 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 10.0% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Infantile Spasms Therapeutics Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Mal Incrodt</Li><Li> H.
