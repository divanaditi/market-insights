Dry AMD, which accounts for a larger portion of cases, is characterized by the gradual breakdown of the macula, leading to vision loss over time. This form of AMD often progresses slowly, and patients may not experience noticeable symptoms until the condition is advanced. Due to its gradual nature, dry AMD treatment mainly focuses on slowing the progression through lifestyle changes and dietary supplements. However, research into gene therapy and stem cell treatments is ongoing to find more effective solutions for dry AMD. The dry AMD segment continues to dominate the market in Germany, given the increasing elderly population and the prevalence of this form of the disease.<p>On the other hand, wet AMD is a more aggressive and rapidly progressing form of the disease, driven by abnormal blood vessel growth under the retina. This condition leads to sudden and severe vision loss if not treated promptly. Anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) therapies have become the ultimate treatment option for wet AMD, significantly improving outcomes for patients. The wet AMD segment has seen remarkable advancements in treatment, with various injectable drugs available that help control the abnormal blood vessel growth. These therapies, along with other options like laser treatments and photodynamic therapy, have led to improved prognosis for patients. Although wet AMD cases are less common compared to dry AMD, the severity and rapid progression of the condition make it a critical focus in the German market.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/868174/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Age-related Macular Degeneration Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Age-related Macular Degeneration Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Age-related Macular Degeneration Market Market size was valued at USD 10.8 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 17.8 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Age-related Macular Degeneration Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Bayer HealthCare</Li><Li> F.
