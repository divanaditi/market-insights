Chemotherapy remains a cornerstone of ATLL management, offering options such as multi-drug regimens that include agents like cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and methotrexate. These chemotherapy regimens aim to reduce the tumor burden and manage disease progression. Despite being a standard treatment option, chemotherapy can often be associated with significant side effects, such as immunosuppression and hematologic toxicity, which may limit its long-term efficacy. This has led to increased exploration of alternative treatment approaches, including targeted therapies designed to offer more precise and less toxic interventions for ATLL patients. On the other hand, targeted therapy has gained traction in the treatment of ATLL due to its ability to focus on specific molecular targets involved in tumor growth and survival. Agents such as monoclonal antibodies, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and small molecule inhibitors have shown promise in clinical trials for improving patient outcomes. These therapies aim to enhance the immune system's ability to recognize and eliminate cancer cells while minimizing collateral damage to healthy tissues. As research advances, these targeted therapies are expected to play an increasingly significant role in the management of ATLL in Germany.
