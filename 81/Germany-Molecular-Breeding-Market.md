Marker-assisted selection (MAS) is a widely adopted technique that uses molecular markers to select plants or animals with desirable traits. This approach helps to enhance the efficiency of breeding programs, particularly in agriculture, by improving traits such as disease resistance, drought tolerance, and yield. MAS is increasingly used for crops such as wheat, maize, and rice, where breeders can efficiently track genetic variations. As the demand for higher agricultural productivity grows, MAS is expected to maintain a significant share of the market in Germany, particularly due to its ability to shorten breeding cycles and improve precision in trait selection. <p>On the other hand, genomic selection (GS) represents a cutting-edge approach, leveraging genome-wide markers to predict breeding values for traits that are difficult to observe directly. This technology is gaining traction due to its ability to handle complex traits with higher accuracy. In the context of livestock breeding, GS helps optimize traits like growth rate, milk production, and disease resistance, thereby improving overall herd performance. The increasing adoption of next-generation sequencing technologies is further propelling the growth of genomic selection in Germany. Additionally, the rise of precision breeding and the growing emphasis on sustainability in agriculture are fueling the demand for advanced molecular breeding techniques, such as GS, to meet the challenges of food security and climate change.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/871232/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Molecular Breeding Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Molecular Breeding Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Molecular Breeding Market size was valued at USD 3.2 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 6.5 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 9.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Molecular Breeding Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Eurofins</Li><Li> Thermo Fisher</Li><Li> Illumina</Li><Li> SGS</Li><Li> LGC Group</Li><Li> Danbred</Li><Li> Intertek</Li><Li> Lemnatec</Li><Li> Charles River</Li><Li> Slipstream Automation</Li><Li> Fruitbreedomics</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Molecular Breeding Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Molecular Breeding Market apart.
