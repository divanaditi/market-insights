Low concentration sulfuric acid, typically ranging from 50% to 78% H₂SO₄, is widely used in industries like agriculture, where it serves as a vital component in the production of fertilizers. This form of sulfuric acid is also employed in the cleaning of metals, oil refining, and in chemical processes that require a moderate level of acidity. The demand for low concentration sulfuric acid in Germany has been driven by the country's strong agricultural and chemical sectors, which continue to rely on this type for various applications including pH adjustment and the manufacture of phosphate-based fertilizers. High concentration sulfuric acid, with concentrations typically greater than 98%, is essential in industries such as petrochemical refining, battery production, and the manufacture of synthetic materials. This highly corrosive substance is also used in the production of explosives and in various chemical synthesis processes, where strong acidity is crucial. The demand for high concentration sulfuric acid is largely attributed to the robust automotive and industrial manufacturing sectors in Germany.
