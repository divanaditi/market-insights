Wet scrubbers are widely utilized for their efficiency in removing harmful gases and particulate matter from exhaust gases. These systems use a liquid to capture pollutants, making them ideal for industries with high emissions, such as power generation, chemical manufacturing, and metal processing. The increasing environmental regulations and growing emphasis on sustainability in Germany have propelled the demand for wet scrubbers. These systems are also more effective at handling a wider range of pollutants, including sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides, which are commonly produced in industrial operations.</p><p>On the other hand, dry scrubbers are gaining popularity due to their lower water usage and the ability to operate in environments where water availability is limited. They use a dry reagent or alkaline material to neutralize acidic gases, particularly sulfur dioxide, and other pollutants. Dry scrubbers are often preferred in industries with space constraints or those looking to reduce water consumption. They offer a more compact and cost-effective solution compared to wet scrubbers, making them suitable for applications where water treatment infrastructure is not feasible.
