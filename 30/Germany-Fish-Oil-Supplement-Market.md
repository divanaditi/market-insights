Natural fish oil, which is extracted directly from the tissues of fatty fish, remains a popular choice due to its high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA and DHA. This type of fish oil is widely used for general health benefits, such as improving heart health, reducing inflammation, and supporting cognitive function. Its natural composition makes it highly favored among consumers looking for holistic wellness solutions. The growing awareness about the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids in maintaining a healthy lifestyle has contributed to the increased demand for natural fish oil supplements in Germany. Additionally, these supplements are often available in various forms, such as capsules, liquids, and soft gels, catering to different consumer preferences.</p><p>Concentrated fish oil supplements, on the other hand, are processed to contain higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids than regular natural fish oil. This type of supplement appeals to consumers seeking a more potent dosage of EPA and DHA for targeted health benefits, such as improving joint health, supporting eye health, and boosting immunity. The concentrated fish oil market is also driven by advancements in extraction technologies, which have enhanced the purity and effectiveness of these products. With a more concentrated omega-3 content, these supplements are often marketed as a solution for individuals with specific health concerns or those who require higher omega-3 intake.
