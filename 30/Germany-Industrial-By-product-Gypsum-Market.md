The first category includes flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) gypsum, which is a major by-product of coal-fired power plants. FGD gypsum is produced when sulfur dioxide is removed from flue gases through a desulfurization process. This type of gypsum is widely used in the production of building materials, including drywall and plaster. As an environmentally-friendly alternative to natural gypsum, FGD gypsum is gaining significant traction in the construction sector due to its sustainability and cost-effectiveness. The demand for FGD gypsum has been on the rise as industries seek to reduce environmental impact and utilize waste materials for construction purposes. The growing adoption of FGD gypsum is expected to fuel market growth, driven by its use in the manufacturing of various products such as cement and tiles.<p>Another significant segment within the Germany industrial by-product gypsum market is phosphogypsum. This by-product is primarily derived from the production of phosphoric acid, a key ingredient in fertilizers. Phosphogypsum contains impurities such as heavy metals, but when properly treated, it can be used in a range of industrial applications. It is often employed in the production of cement, where it serves as a setting retardant, preventing the premature hardening of cement mixtures. Despite concerns over its environmental impact due to the presence of hazardous materials, phosphogypsum is still used in a controlled manner in various industrial applications. As the market for sustainable building materials continues to expand, phosphogypsum is expected to see continued demand, particularly in cement manufacturing, where its by-product nature offers cost-effective alternatives to natural gypsum.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/483110/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Industrial By-product Gypsum Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Industrial By-product Gypsum Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Industrial By-product Gypsum Market size was valued at USD 1.8 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.7 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Industrial By-product Gypsum Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Knauf Gips</Li><Li> LafargeHolcim</Li><Li> National Gypsum</Li><Li> PABCO Gypsum</Li><Li> USG</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Industrial By-product Gypsum Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Industrial By-product Gypsum Market apart.
