These sensors are favored in environments where high precision and fast processing are crucial, such as in automotive, electronics, and packaging industries. Their ability to generate clear, sharp images and work effectively under different lighting conditions makes them ideal for tasks like barcode reading, surface inspection, and alignment checking. With advancements in sensor technology, the 2D vision sensor market continues to grow in response to the demand for automation and quality assurance across various industrial sectors.<p>On the other hand, 3D vision sensors are gaining popularity for more complex tasks that require depth perception and spatial analysis. These sensors are essential for applications such as robotic guidance, automated material handling, and assembly line processes where three-dimensional data is needed to improve accuracy and efficiency. By capturing not only the x and y coordinates but also the z-axis data, 3D sensors enhance robotic precision and optimize production workflows.
