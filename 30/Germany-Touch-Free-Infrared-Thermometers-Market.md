Handheld infrared thermometers dominate the market due to their portability, ease of use, and suitability for both home and clinical applications. These thermometers are commonly used in healthcare settings, such as hospitals and clinics, as well as for personal use in homes. The convenience and accuracy offered by handheld infrared thermometers make them an ideal choice for quick temperature readings without direct contact, which is crucial for preventing the spread of infections. Furthermore, the increasing awareness of hygiene and safety measures has led to a surge in the demand for handheld devices, particularly in the context of the ongoing health concerns.<p>On the other hand, fixed infrared thermometers are gaining traction in the Germany market, particularly for industrial and commercial applications. These devices are typically installed at entry points in high-traffic areas like airports, shopping malls, and offices for non-contact temperature monitoring. Fixed thermometers provide continuous monitoring and can handle large volumes of individuals without the need for physical contact. They are equipped with advanced sensors and algorithms, enabling accurate readings at a distance.
