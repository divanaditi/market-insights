Cardiotomy filters are specifically designed for use in cardiopulmonary bypass procedures, where they play a critical role in filtering blood during heart surgeries. These filters help in removing debris, air, and blood clots that may cause complications during surgery. As the demand for cardiovascular surgeries continues to rise, cardiotomy filters are expected to witness significant growth in the coming years. These filters are essential in minimizing the risks associated with surgery and improving patient outcomes, driving their adoption across hospitals and surgical centers in Germany.</p><p>Non-cardiotomy filters, on the other hand, are used in a wide range of medical procedures that do not involve direct heart surgeries but still require filtration of blood or fluids. These filters are primarily employed in emergency situations, vascular surgeries, and for patients requiring long-term filtration due to chronic conditions. Non-cardiotomy filters are gaining traction due to their versatility and ability to support a broader set of medical applications, leading to increased market share in Germany.
