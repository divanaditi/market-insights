Fiber lasers are gaining traction due to their high efficiency, precision, and ability to process a variety of materials. These lasers offer excellent beam quality, fast processing speeds, and low maintenance costs, making them ideal for industrial applications such as cutting, engraving, and welding. CO2 lasers, on the other hand, are widely used for cutting non-metallic materials, including plastics and wood, and are known for their high output power and versatility. Diode lasers, which are relatively new in the micromachining market, are being utilized for applications that demand high precision with minimal heat input, making them suitable for thin material processing and micro-drilling applications. As each type of laser technology offers distinct benefits, manufacturers in Germany are increasingly adopting a mix of these technologies based on specific machining requirements.</p><p>The choice of laser type in the industrial micromachining market depends largely on the material to be processed and the required precision. Fiber lasers are expected to lead the market due to their scalability, cost-effectiveness, and high processing speeds. The ability to handle complex geometries with extreme precision is making fiber lasers a preferred choice in industries such as electronics, automotive, and medical device manufacturing. CO2 lasers, with their long-established presence in the market, remain relevant for applications where large-scale cutting or engraving of softer materials is needed.
