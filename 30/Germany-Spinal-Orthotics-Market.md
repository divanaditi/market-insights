Rigid orthotics are designed to provide significant immobilization and support to the spine, often used in cases of severe injury, post-surgery, or for patients suffering from chronic spinal conditions. These devices are constructed from materials such as plastic, carbon fiber, and metal, which allow for the required rigidity. They are especially effective in preventing further spinal damage, improving posture, and alleviating pain. The demand for rigid orthotics is anticipated to rise as the aging population in Germany experiences higher incidences of spinal issues like scoliosis, degenerative disc diseases, and fractures, which require more robust intervention for spinal protection and alignment.<p>On the other hand, flexible orthotics offer more comfort and mobility compared to rigid types, making them ideal for patients seeking pain relief with greater ease of movement. Flexible spinal orthotics are typically made from softer materials like elastomers, which provide sufficient support while allowing some degree of spinal movement. These orthotics are particularly beneficial for patients with less severe conditions or those in need of rehabilitation.
