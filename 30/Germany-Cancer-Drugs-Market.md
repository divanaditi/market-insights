Chemotherapy is one of the most widely used treatments for cancer, involving the use of chemical substances to destroy cancer cells or inhibit their growth. It has been a primary form of treatment for many years, especially for solid tumors and blood cancers. Immunotherapy, on the other hand, uses the body's immune system to fight cancer cells. This has seen increasing adoption in recent years due to its effectiveness in treating cancers such as melanoma and lung cancer. Targeted therapy focuses on specific molecules involved in the growth of cancer cells, offering a more personalized treatment approach with fewer side effects compared to traditional chemotherapy. Hormonal therapy is primarily used in cancers that are hormone-sensitive, such as breast and prostate cancer, to block or regulate hormone production that fuels cancer growth.</p><p>In addition to these major drug types, the market also includes emerging treatments like gene therapy and precision medicine, which have gained momentum in recent years. These therapies are designed to target the genetic mutations driving cancer growth, offering a tailored approach based on the patient’s genetic profile.
