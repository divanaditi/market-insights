These kits are widely utilized in the detection of specific food allergens through chemical reactions that target allergenic proteins. Immunoassays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and lateral flow devices (LFD), are popular in both laboratories and on-site testing. They offer high sensitivity and specificity, making them suitable for detecting allergens like peanuts, gluten, and milk. The demand for immunoassay-based kits is growing due to their ease of use, cost-effectiveness, and ability to detect allergens quickly, even in complex food matrices. This segment is expected to continue its expansion as food safety regulations become more stringent, pushing manufacturers to adopt more efficient testing technologies to meet compliance requirements and consumer safety expectations in Germany.</p><p>Another prominent type of food allergen testing kits in Germany is the PCR-based testing kits. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing involves analyzing the genetic material of allergens in food samples, providing a highly accurate method for allergen detection. This type of testing is especially important for detecting allergens at lower concentrations, which might be missed by other methods. PCR-based kits are particularly useful for detecting allergens like soy, fish, and tree nuts, which are known to pose serious health risks. Due to their precision and ability to provide results in a shorter amount of time, these kits are increasingly favored in the food industry for both regulatory and quality control purposes. The demand for PCR-based testing is anticipated to grow as food manufacturers in Germany place greater emphasis on traceability and consumer safety.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/485108/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Food Allergen Testing Kits Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Food Allergen Testing Kits Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Food Allergen Testing Kits Market size was valued at USD 1.3 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.5 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 8.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Food Allergen Testing Kits Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Neogen</Li><Li> SGS S.A.</Li><Li> Intertek Group plc</Li><Li> TUV SUD Psb Pte.
