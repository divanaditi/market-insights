The most common types include rigid and flexible dynamic stabilization systems. Rigid systems typically offer a more controlled stabilization solution, providing stability to the spine while allowing for minimal movement. These systems are mainly used in cases of severe spinal deformities and for providing long-term support. On the other hand, flexible dynamic stabilization systems are designed to allow controlled movement, mimicking the natural motion of the spine. These systems are ideal for patients who require a balance between stability and flexibility, making them suitable for conditions like degenerative disc disease and spinal stenosis. Both types of systems are widely utilized in spine surgeries, offering specific benefits tailored to the patient’s needs, with flexible systems gaining popularity for their ability to preserve motion.<p>Another key classification within the market involves hybrid systems, which combine elements of both rigid and flexible stabilization. These systems are designed to provide enhanced stability while still maintaining some degree of motion in the affected area of the spine.
