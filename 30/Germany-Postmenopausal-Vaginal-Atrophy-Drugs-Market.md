Local estrogen therapy remains one of the most commonly prescribed treatments for postmenopausal vaginal atrophy. This therapy helps restore estrogen levels in the vaginal tissues, alleviating symptoms like dryness, irritation, and painful intercourse. Non-estrogen therapy options, including selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and vaginal DHEA, are gaining traction among patients who are contraindicated for estrogen therapy. These alternatives offer a targeted approach to improving vaginal health without the systemic effects of estrogen. Additionally, vaginal moisturizers play a crucial role in alleviating dryness and discomfort, providing temporary relief and improving the overall quality of life for postmenopausal women. The diverse array of treatment options contributes to the market's steady growth, as patients seek tailored solutions for their symptoms.</p><p>Among the various types of drugs, local estrogen therapy continues to dominate the market in Germany, owing to its efficacy and direct delivery method.
