The metal-on-polyethylene segment has seen significant demand due to its cost-effectiveness and reliability in clinical settings. These prostheses are typically used in patients with osteoarthritis or other degenerative joint conditions, as they provide optimal wear characteristics while minimizing complications. Metal-on-metal prostheses, although less common, remain a viable option in certain cases where durability and strength are crucial. However, the market for metal-on-metal is seeing a decline due to concerns over wear debris and potential adverse effects on patients' health. On the other hand, ceramic-on-polyethylene and ceramic-on-ceramic options are gaining traction, particularly among younger patients or those with more active lifestyles, as they offer reduced wear rates and enhanced longevity in joint function.</p><p>In addition to wear resistance, the demand for ceramic-on-ceramic prostheses has increased because of their low friction and long-lasting performance. These materials offer improved clinical outcomes, particularly for patients with a higher activity level. Despite their advantages, ceramic-on-ceramic prostheses come with a higher cost, which can be a factor in decision-making for both healthcare providers and patients. Metal-on-metal prostheses, while still available, have been gradually phased out in favor of alternatives due to safety concerns. The ceramic and polyethylene combinations are expected to dominate the market in the coming years, with a focus on improving material technologies to reduce failure rates.
