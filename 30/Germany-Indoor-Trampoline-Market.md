One prominent segment is the rectangular trampolines, which are often favored for their superior bounce and larger surface area, making them ideal for fitness enthusiasts and professional athletes. These trampolines are designed to offer stability and precision, allowing users to perform a variety of activities, from casual jumping to advanced gymnastics. As they are typically used in gyms and recreational centers, their demand has seen a rise among those seeking more controlled and efficient workout environments. Their versatility in both commercial and home settings further boosts their appeal in the German market.</p><p>Another key segment within the market is the round trampolines, which are commonly used for recreational purposes and in family settings.
