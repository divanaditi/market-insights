The contact mode AFM is commonly used in industries such as semiconductor manufacturing and material science, as it offers high-resolution imaging by scanning the surface with a sharp tip that makes physical contact with the sample. This type of AFM provides detailed information about surface topography, roughness, and mechanical properties. Its reliability in analyzing hard and soft materials has made it popular among researchers and industrial applications, contributing to its significant market share in Germany. Additionally, the contact mode AFM is often preferred for its precise force measurement capabilities, which are essential in quality control processes within various industrial sectors, particularly in the automotive and electronics industries.</p><p>On the other hand, non-contact mode AFM operates by scanning the surface without making direct contact, using the attractive forces between the probe and the sample. This mode minimizes sample damage, making it ideal for soft or delicate materials that could be affected by physical contact. Non-contact mode AFMs are especially beneficial in industries dealing with biological samples, polymers, and nanoscale coatings. The increasing demand for non-invasive testing and high-resolution imaging in sectors like biotechnology and pharmaceuticals is driving the adoption of non-contact AFMs. As Germany continues to advance in the development of nanotechnology and life sciences, the market for non-contact AFM is expected to experience substantial growth, offering enhanced imaging capabilities for a wide range of applications.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/483746/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Industrial Atomic Force Microscope Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Industrial Atomic Force Microscope Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Industrial Atomic Force Microscope Market size was valued at USD 1.2 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.5 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 9.93% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Industrial Atomic Force Microscope Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Asylum Research</Li><Li> Bruker</Li><Li> Nanosurf</Li><Li> AIST-NT</Li><Li> WITec</Li><Li> CS Instruments</Li><Li> DME</Li><Li> Hitachi High Technologies</Li><Li> ICSPI</Li><Li> JPK Instruments</Li><Li> Keysight Technologies</Li><Li> Molecular Vista</Li><Li> NanoMagnetics Instruments</Li><Li> Nanonics Imaging</Li><Li> Nanoscience Instruments</Li><Li> RHK Technology</Li><Li> ST Instruments</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Industrial Atomic Force Microscope Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Industrial Atomic Force Microscope Market apart.
