Momentary foot switches are designed to be activated only as long as they are pressed. These switches are commonly used in industries where short bursts of control are necessary, such as in manufacturing environments where the operator needs temporary control over a machine. Momentary switches are reliable, easy to operate, and are designed for high-frequency use. Their application is seen in machines that require a single action for a short period, such as during a start or stop function. These switches are also used in medical equipment, where precision and quick action are essential for proper functioning.</p><p>On the other hand, maintained foot switches remain in their last position until manually reset. These are suitable for industrial applications that require continuous operation or functions that need to be locked in place, such as for safety equipment or controls that demand uninterrupted action. Maintained switches are widely used in assembly lines, automated systems, and heavy-duty machinery where a sustained operation is required without constant user intervention. Their ability to stay in an activated or deactivated state makes them ideal for operations that involve complex workflows, where hands-free control is necessary.
