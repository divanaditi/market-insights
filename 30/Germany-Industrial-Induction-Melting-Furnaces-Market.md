The core types include channel furnaces, crucible furnaces, and coreless furnaces. Channel furnaces are primarily used for non-ferrous metals like aluminum and copper, offering excellent energy efficiency and a high level of process control. These furnaces are ideal for industries requiring continuous or batch melting operations. Crucible furnaces, which feature a crucible that holds the molten material, are typically utilized for smaller batches and provide flexibility in terms of metal types. They are commonly found in smaller operations and are valued for their ease of use and portability. On the other hand, coreless induction furnaces are among the most commonly used in large-scale operations, offering high melting rates and efficient energy use, especially for ferrous and non-ferrous alloys.</p><p>Among these, coreless induction furnaces dominate the market in Germany, driven by their widespread use in both ferrous and non-ferrous metal processing. These furnaces allow for efficient energy consumption and offer superior temperature control, making them ideal for high-volume operations. Their ability to melt large quantities of metal quickly and effectively makes them highly desirable in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and metal recycling.
