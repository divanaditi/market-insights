EBRT is one of the most widely used techniques in radiation oncology, wherein high-energy beams are directed at the tumor from outside the body. This method is highly effective for treating various cancers, including brain, prostate, and breast cancer. With continuous advancements in technology, such as image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), EBRT has witnessed significant growth. These innovations improve the precision and effectiveness of treatment, reducing the risk of damage to surrounding healthy tissues, thus enhancing patient outcomes. The demand for EBRT is expected to rise in the coming years due to its non-invasive nature and the increasing prevalence of cancer in Germany.</p><p>On the other hand, internal radiation therapy, also known as brachytherapy, involves placing radioactive material directly inside or near the tumor. This treatment type is particularly beneficial for cancers of the prostate, cervix, and breast. Brachytherapy allows for a high dose of radiation to be delivered directly to the cancerous cells while minimizing exposure to healthy tissue. It is increasingly preferred due to its targeted approach and shorter treatment times compared to EBRT. With advancements in techniques such as high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy, the adoption of IRT is expected to increase. Germany’s radiation oncology market is witnessing a growing preference for IRT, as it provides effective solutions for localized cancers, offering a promising outlook for this segment in the future.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/481787/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Radiation Oncology Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Radiation Oncology Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Radiation Oncology Market size was valued at USD 8.2 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 11.5 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.2% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Radiation Oncology Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Accuray</Li><Li> C.
