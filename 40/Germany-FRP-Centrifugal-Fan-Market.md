Backward-inclined fans dominate the market due to their efficiency and ability to handle high-pressure applications. These fans are widely utilized in industrial processes where durability and resistance to corrosive environments are critical. Their aerodynamic design ensures minimal energy consumption, making them a preferred choice for various applications. Forward-curved fans, on the other hand, are known for their compact design and high airflow capabilities. These are commonly employed in HVAC systems and low-pressure ventilation needs. Radial fans cater to industries requiring robust equipment to handle particulate matter or contaminated air streams, such as mining, chemical manufacturing, and power plants.</p><p>Other specialized designs, including mixed-flow and custom-built FRP centrifugal fans, also hold a niche yet significant position in the market. Mixed-flow fans combine features of axial and centrifugal designs to offer a balance between airflow and pressure requirements, making them suitable for applications with unique performance demands. Custom-built fans are designed for specific industrial operations, ensuring precise alignment with operational needs. These options cater to industries that require highly tailored solutions to meet unique airflow challenges.
