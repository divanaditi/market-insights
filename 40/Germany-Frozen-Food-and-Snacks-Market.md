Frozen ready meals are among the most popular items, catering to busy consumers who seek convenient, quick meal solutions. This segment includes a wide range of offerings, from frozen pizzas and pasta dishes to complete frozen dinners. In addition to ready meals, frozen vegetables have seen a steady rise in popularity due to the growing trend of healthy eating and the need for convenient, nutritious options.

These snack items are commonly found in households and are frequently purchased for quick meals or as part of casual dining experiences. The market also includes frozen bakery products such as croissants, pastries, and pizzas, which provide consumers with quick and easy alternatives for breakfast or dinner. With the rising popularity of plant-based diets, there has been a noticeable shift towards frozen plant-based snacks, which include items like veggie burgers and meatless nuggets.
