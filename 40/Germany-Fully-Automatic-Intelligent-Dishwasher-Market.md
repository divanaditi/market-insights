Built-in dishwashers are designed to be integrated into kitchen cabinetry, offering a seamless and space-efficient solution. These models are particularly popular in modern homes and apartments where space optimization is crucial. Built-in dishwashers provide a sleek and streamlined appearance, making them ideal for consumers seeking high-end aesthetics and convenience. They also typically come with advanced features like multiple wash cycles, adjustable racks, and energy-efficient settings, appealing to consumers with a focus on performance and sustainability. As a result, the built-in segment is expected to experience steady growth in the coming years.<p>On the other hand, freestanding dishwashers are standalone units that can be placed anywhere in the kitchen, offering flexibility and ease of installation.
