Tissue sealants are commonly used in various surgical procedures to prevent fluid leakage and enhance the healing process. These sealants are applied to soft tissues, such as in cardiovascular, plastic, and gastrointestinal surgeries, to provide a protective barrier and reduce the risk of complications like leakage. Tissue sealants are available in different forms, such as liquid, gel, or spray, offering surgeons versatile options for specific applications. This segment's growth is driven by the increasing demand for minimally invasive surgeries and the growing need for faster recovery times, which tissue sealants can facilitate by providing immediate sealing and promoting tissue adhesion. <p>On the other hand, bone sealants are designed to aid in the repair of bone fractures or defects. These products are primarily used in orthopedic surgeries, including spinal and trauma surgeries. Bone sealants are typically composed of biocompatible materials that promote osteoconductivity and allow for better bone healing. With advances in biomaterials, bone sealants have become more effective in preventing complications like infection and non-union, significantly improving patient outcomes. The growing elderly population and the rising incidence of bone-related injuries contribute to the robust demand for these sealants in the German market. As the market matures, the introduction of innovative bone sealants with enhanced properties, such as faster setting times and better mechanical strength, is expected to further drive growth in this segment.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/549638/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Surgical Sealants Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Surgical Sealants Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Surgical Sealants Market size was valued at USD 3.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 6.1 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Surgical Sealants Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Ethicon</Li><Li> C.R.Bard</Li><Li> CSL Behring</Li><Li> CryoLife</Li><Li> Baxter</Li><Li> Cohera Medical</Li><Li> Kuraray America</Li><Li> Johnson & Johnson</Li><Li> Medtronic</Li><Li> Tissuemed</Li><Li> Vivostat</Li><Li> Ocular Therapeutix</Li><Li> B.
