The freestanding dishwasher category holds a significant share in the market due to its ease of installation and portability. These dishwashers are ideal for households with limited kitchen space or those seeking flexibility. They can be placed anywhere in the kitchen, making them a convenient option for consumers. Freestanding dishwashers also cater to a wide range of price points, appealing to both budget-conscious buyers and those willing to invest in high-end models. Additionally, built-in dishwashers are gaining popularity, particularly in new kitchen designs. These dishwashers are integrated into the cabinetry for a sleek, space-saving solution and offer enhanced aesthetic appeal for modern kitchens.<p>Another significant segment in the market is the slimline dishwasher, which is particularly suited for smaller households or apartments where space is limited. These dishwashers are typically 45 cm wide, compared to the standard 60 cm models, providing an excellent option without compromising on performance. As urban living trends continue to grow in Germany, slimline dishwashers are becoming increasingly sought after. On the other hand, compact dishwashers are growing in demand as well, offering portability and practicality for smaller homes or even office kitchens. These models typically serve fewer people but offer greater efficiency in small spaces, appealing to single-person households or small families.
