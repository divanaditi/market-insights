Glycerol-based ECH dominates the market due to the abundant availability of glycerol as a byproduct of biodiesel production. This makes glycerol a cost-effective and sustainable raw material for bio-based ECH production. The glycerol-based ECH is used extensively in the production of epoxy resins, which are applied in a wide range of industries, including automotive, construction, and electronics. With growing environmental concerns, the demand for glycerol-based bio-epichlorohydrin is expected to rise as it aligns with sustainability goals, offering a greener alternative to conventional methods that rely on petrochemical derivatives. <p>In addition to glycerol-based ECH, other bio-based sources, including renewable plant-based feedstocks, contribute to the overall growth of the market. These alternatives are gaining attention as they support the shift towards circular economies and reduced carbon footprints.
