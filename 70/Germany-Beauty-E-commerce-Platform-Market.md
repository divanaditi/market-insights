Product-based platforms focus primarily on the online sale of beauty and skincare products, including cosmetics, haircare, fragrance, and personal care items. These platforms often offer a wide variety of brands, catering to diverse consumer preferences. With increasing consumer demand for personalized beauty solutions, many product-based e-commerce platforms in Germany have integrated features like virtual try-ons or AI-driven product recommendations. The rapid growth of online retail, coupled with the convenience of home delivery, has significantly contributed to the expansion of the product-based beauty segment in the country. This category is further driven by trends like clean beauty and sustainable packaging, which have become essential aspects of consumer purchasing decisions in the beauty industry.<p>On the other hand, service-based platforms offer specialized beauty services such as virtual beauty consultations, personalized skincare routines, and online beauty training. These platforms leverage technology to provide consumers with expert advice and customized experiences from the comfort of their homes. Services like virtual makeup tutorials, skincare assessments, and personalized beauty regimens are becoming increasingly popular among German consumers, as they allow for a more tailored approach to beauty. Service-based platforms in Germany also cater to the growing demand for at-home beauty treatments, offering everything from virtual facials to online haircare consultations.
