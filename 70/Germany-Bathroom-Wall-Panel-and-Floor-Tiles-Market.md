Another key segment is the porcelain tiles category, known for their superior strength and water resistance. These tiles are often used in high-traffic bathroom areas due to their long-lasting qualities. Additionally, natural stone tiles such as marble, granite, and slate are gaining popularity due to their premium aesthetics and luxury appeal. These materials provide a unique, elegant look, and are increasingly seen in upscale bathroom designs. The demand for these high-end tiles is being driven by a growing preference for more customized and sophisticated bathroom renovations in the German market.</p><p>Another prominent segment in the market is the vinyl and PVC-based wall panels and floor tiles. These materials are gaining traction due to their affordability, easy installation, and versatility in design. Vinyl tiles are especially popular in both residential and commercial applications because they are moisture-resistant and available in a wide range of styles and colors.
