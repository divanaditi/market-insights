Manual curb adapters are widely used for their simplicity and cost-effectiveness, especially in residential areas and smaller-scale applications. These devices are typically operated through a mechanical process, offering an affordable and reliable solution for controlling traffic flow or restricting access to certain zones. The demand for manual curb adapters remains strong due to their ease of installation and low maintenance requirements, making them a popular choice among municipal authorities and property owners. <p>On the other hand, automatic curb adapters are gaining traction in urban and commercial applications due to their enhanced convenience and technological features.
