Their ability to control light while ensuring privacy has made them a preferred option in ship interior design. Additionally, roller blinds can be customized to fit the specific dimensions of ship windows, providing both aesthetic appeal and practicality for the ship's occupants.</p><p>Curtains are another key segment in the market, offering a softer, more decorative alternative to roller blinds.
