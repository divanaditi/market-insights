Organic cumin powder is gaining popularity due to the rising demand for natural and chemical-free food products. Consumers are increasingly becoming health-conscious, preferring organic products for their perceived health benefits. This segment is also supported by the growing trend of sustainable agriculture and eco-friendly farming practices. Organic cumin powder is often sold at a premium price, attracting a niche market of health enthusiasts and environmentally aware buyers. This type of cumin powder is also becoming common in specialty food stores and online platforms that cater to health-conscious customers.</p><p>Conventional cumin powder, on the other hand, dominates the broader market due to its affordability and widespread availability. It is produced using conventional farming methods and is widely used in both households and the food industry. This type of cumin powder appeals to a larger customer base, from everyday consumers to food manufacturers. Conventional cumin powder is utilized in a variety of applications, from seasoning for meats and curries to flavoring in snacks and processed foods.
