The foundation segment holds a dominant share in the market, offering products in various formulations such as liquid, powder, and cream. Liquid foundations are particularly popular due to their easy application and buildable coverage. These products cater to different skin types, providing options like oil-free foundations for oily skin and hydrating foundations for dry skin. Additionally, the demand for mineral foundations is rising, driven by the growing consumer awareness of natural and organic ingredients. The increasing inclination toward a flawless complexion and long-lasting wear further boosts the popularity of foundations in Germany. <p>Primers, another significant segment, have witnessed steady growth in the German makeup base market.

The market offers a wide variety of primers, including pore-minimizing, mattifying, and hydrating primers, catering to different skin concerns. As consumers become more educated about skincare and makeup routines, the demand for primers has expanded. Moreover, products designed to offer additional benefits, such as SPF protection or anti-aging properties, have further spurred growth in this segment.
