They are typically more lightweight and easier to store, making them a popular choice for households and small spaces. The versatility of canister vacuum cleaners, combined with strong suction power and various attachments for different surfaces, further enhances their appeal to German consumers looking for convenience and performance in their cleaning appliances.</p><p>Another prominent type in the market is the upright vacuum cleaner, which is commonly used for larger spaces such as offices and homes with extensive carpeted areas.

Upright models are particularly suitable for high-traffic areas due to their robust build and superior cleaning performance. The increasing preference for energy-efficient and multifunctional vacuum cleaners is driving demand for upright models, which can handle both carpets and hard floors effectively.
