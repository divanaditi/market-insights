Additionally, undermount and top-mount sinks are also commonly found, offering different installation styles to meet aesthetic and functional demands. The increasing trend towards modern, sleek designs has contributed to the growing demand for stainless steel, granite composite, and porcelain sinks, which offer durability, ease of maintenance, and resistance to stains.In the bathroom sink category, both wall-mounted and countertop models are popular, with the latter offering a more luxurious, contemporary appearance.
