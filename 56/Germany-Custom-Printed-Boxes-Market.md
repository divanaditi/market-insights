Rigid boxes, on the other hand, are often used for premium products, such as electronics, luxury items, and cosmetics, offering a sophisticated and sturdy option that enhances product appeal. Folding cartons are typically used for retail packaging and food products, being lightweight and customizable in terms of design, while flexible packaging is growing in popularity for food and beverage products due to its adaptability, ease of use, and ability to extend shelf life.<p>The segmentation also highlights specific demands for custom printed boxes in sectors like food & beverage, consumer goods, healthcare, and electronics. Each industry has different packaging needs, driving demand for various types of custom boxes. In the food and beverage sector, folding cartons and flexible packaging are preferred for their lightweight nature and ability to preserve freshness. The healthcare industry requires rigid and corrugated boxes to ensure that pharmaceuticals are safely transported without damage or contamination. Consumer goods manufacturers often opt for corrugated boxes and folding cartons that provide both durability and aesthetic appeal for branding purposes. The electronics sector typically demands high-quality rigid boxes that provide additional protection for fragile products.
