Maternity panties are another key segment, offering support for the growing belly and promoting comfort throughout the day. These panties are made from soft, stretchy materials and come in various cuts, including briefs, thongs, and bikini styles, to suit different preferences. The increasing awareness about the importance of comfortable and supportive innerwear during pregnancy has boosted the demand for both these types in the German market, especially among first-time mothers.<p>In addition to bras and panties, the market also includes other types of maternity innerwear such as shapewear and maternity camisoles.
