Liquid sachets dominate the market due to their convenience and wide applications in beverages, skincare, and pharmaceuticals. The demand for ready-to-drink beverages, including juices, coffee, and energy drinks, has led to the growth of liquid single-dose sachets in both the consumer and commercial sectors. In addition, the ease of using liquid sachets in daily skincare routines, especially in cosmetics and personal care, contributes significantly to their popularity. These sachets offer portion-controlled, hassle-free usage, which appeals to time-conscious consumers seeking convenience.On the other hand, powder sachets are experiencing steady growth in the market, particularly for products like powdered beverages, nutritional supplements, and instant food. Powdered forms provide extended shelf life, cost-effectiveness, and ease of storage, making them ideal for both household and industrial uses. Single-dose powder sachets cater to the growing trend of on-the-go products, offering a lightweight and portable solution. Gel sachets, though less prevalent than liquid and powder variants, are gaining traction in specific sectors such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products due to their unique formulation and targeted application.
