Manual nail clippers hold a significant share of the market, driven by their affordability, simplicity, and ease of use. These clippers are available in various shapes and sizes, offering versatility to consumers. Manual nail clippers are ideal for individuals seeking traditional grooming tools that do not require batteries or electrical components. Their popularity is also bolstered by the fact that they are lightweight, portable, and suitable for both home and travel use.

These clippers are designed for individuals seeking a more efficient, hands-free grooming experience. Electric nail clippers typically come with rechargeable batteries, ergonomic handles, and multiple settings to suit different needs. They are often favored by those with mobility or dexterity issues, as they require less manual effort. The demand for electric nail clippers is on the rise, driven by innovation in design and a growing inclination toward smart grooming solutions.
