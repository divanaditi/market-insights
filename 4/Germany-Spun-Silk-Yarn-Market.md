Traditional spun silk yarn offers excellent drapability and softness, making it ideal for premium fashion apparel and decorative fabrics. Another type includes blended spun silk yarn, which is produced by combining silk with other fibers such as cotton or polyester. This type is often used in mass-market fabrics, offering a balance between luxury and cost-efficiency, making it popular in both domestic and commercial applications.<p>Another prominent segment within the market is the specialty spun silk yarn, which is engineered for specific applications requiring unique characteristics like colorfastness, durability, or resistance to environmental factors. Specialty spun silk yarns often find applications in niche industries such as automotive textiles, medical textiles, and technical fabrics, where performance features are paramount. As sustainability becomes more significant, the demand for eco-friendly spun silk yarns is also on the rise. This type focuses on utilizing natural and renewable resources, such as organic silk or biodegradable fibers, to cater to the growing consumer preference for sustainable products.
