The handheld steam cleaners are one of the most popular types, known for their compact design and versatility. These portable devices are ideal for spot cleaning and reaching difficult areas such as corners and edges. They are widely used for home cleaning, offering convenience without the need for heavy machinery. Handheld steam cleaners are also appreciated for their ease of storage and quick heat-up time, making them suitable for small to medium-sized areas. Their ability to disinfect and sanitize carpets without the use of harsh chemicals further enhances their appeal in environmentally conscious households.</p><p>In contrast, upright steam carpet cleaners are gaining popularity in the German market due to their powerful cleaning capabilities. These models are typically larger and designed for deeper cleaning of expansive carpeted areas, making them ideal for commercial use or larger homes. Equipped with larger water tanks and more robust steam output, upright steam cleaners are known for their efficiency and ability to tackle tough stains and dirt embedded in carpets.
