These technologies and strategies are increasingly popular among fitness enthusiasts who aim to improve endurance, strength, and recovery times in a scientifically backed manner. With growing interest in personalized fitness, the demand for physical biohacking solutions continues to rise as individuals seek more efficient and tailored ways to optimize their workouts and health.<p>The second major segment, mental biohacking, focuses on enhancing cognitive function, mental clarity, and emotional well-being.
