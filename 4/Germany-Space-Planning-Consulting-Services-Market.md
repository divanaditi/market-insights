Office space planning dominates the market due to the growing demand for efficient workspace solutions in corporate environments. Companies are increasingly focusing on optimizing space utilization to promote employee productivity, well-being, and collaboration. As businesses adopt flexible working arrangements, the need for adaptive space planning solutions that cater to changing workstyles is also rising. Retail space planning is another significant segment, driven by the rise in e-commerce and the need for physical retail spaces to provide an engaging customer experience. Consulting firms are focusing on creating retail environments that are not only functional but also align with brand identity and consumer preferences.  <p>Residential space planning services are experiencing steady growth as the demand for personalized home layouts continues to rise.
