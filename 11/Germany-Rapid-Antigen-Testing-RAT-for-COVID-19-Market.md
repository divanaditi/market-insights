The first category includes nasal swab tests, which are among the most common types of rapid antigen tests used in the country. These tests are designed for ease of use, providing results in as little as 15-30 minutes. Nasal swab tests are highly favored for their ability to be self-administered or performed with minimal training. Their popularity is also driven by their cost-effectiveness, making them a suitable option for widespread screening in workplaces, schools, and public events. As a result, nasal swab-based RAT kits represent a significant portion of the market share in Germany, meeting both individual and institutional testing needs effectively.</p><p>The second type of antigen test widely used in Germany is the saliva-based test. These tests offer a less invasive alternative to nasal swabs, making them a more comfortable option for individuals who may find nasal swabs uncomfortable or challenging to administer. Saliva-based RATs have gained traction for their user-friendliness and ability to deliver quick results, typically within 15 to 20 minutes. This type of test has been especially popular in settings like schools, where ease of use is crucial. Moreover, the saliva tests are less likely to cause discomfort or complications during sample collection, which has encouraged their adoption in both public and private sectors. As the demand for more convenient and reliable testing options increases, saliva-based rapid antigen tests continue to capture a growing segment of the market in Germany.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/332792/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Rapid Antigen Testing (RAT) for COVID-19 Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Rapid Antigen Testing (RAT) for COVID-19 Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Rapid Antigen Testing (RAT) for COVID-19 Market size was valued at USD 5.4 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 12.5 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 12.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Rapid Antigen Testing (RAT) for COVID-19 Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Abbott</Li><Li> Quidel</Li><Li> ACCESS BIO</Li><Li> CTK Biotech</Li><Li> SD Biosensor</Li><Li> Ellume</Li><Li> InBios</Li><Li> Celltrion</Li><Li> AESKU.GROUP</Li><Li> ROCHE</Li><Li> BD</Li><Li> OraSure Technologies</Li><Li> Clip Health</Li><Li> LumiraDx</Li><Li> Princeton BioMeditech Corporation</Li><Li> RapiGEN Inc.</Li><Li> Orient Gene</Li><Li> Wondfo Biotech</Li><Li> Ihealth (Andon Health)</Li><Li> Wantai BioPharm</Li><Li> Biotest Biotech</Li><Li> Shenzhen YHLO Biotech</Li><Li> Vazyme Biotech</Li><Li> EasyDiagnosis Biomedicine</Li><Li> Beijing Hotgen Biotech</Li><Li> Assure Tech</Li><Li> Hangzhou AllTest Biotech</Li><Li> ACON Biotech</Li><Li> BGI Genomics</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Rapid Antigen Testing (RAT) for COVID-19 Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Rapid Antigen Testing (RAT) for COVID-19 Market apart.
