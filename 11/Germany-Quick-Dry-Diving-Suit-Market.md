Full-body suits are designed to offer extensive protection and warmth for divers in colder water temperatures, covering the entire body from head to toe. These suits are typically made from advanced materials such as neoprene, which provides insulation and flexibility. Full-body quick-dry diving suits are highly favored for their ability to wick away moisture quickly, allowing divers to stay dry and comfortable even after prolonged exposure to water. Additionally, these suits are often designed with special coatings or membranes to enhance drying time, reducing the overall discomfort of a wet suit after exiting the water.On the other hand, short suits are designed for more moderate conditions, offering less coverage while still providing essential buoyancy and comfort. They are particularly popular in warmer waters, where divers do not require the full insulation of a full-body suit. These suits are generally shorter, covering only the torso and legs, and are more lightweight, offering greater flexibility and mobility. In terms of quick-drying properties, short suits benefit from the same advanced materials as full-body suits but are easier to dry due to their smaller surface area.
