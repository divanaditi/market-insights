Adult nebulization masks are designed to cater to the respiratory needs of adults, ensuring a secure fit and efficient medication delivery during aerosol therapy.

They often feature adjustable straps to ensure comfort and proper positioning during treatment. On the other hand, pediatric nebulization masks are smaller, with a more child-friendly design that minimizes discomfort during use. These masks are specifically crafted to fit children’s smaller faces, providing a safe and effective way to deliver medication in a less intimidating manner, which helps reduce anxiety in young patients undergoing nebulization therapy.</p><p>Additionally, both adult and pediatric PVC nebulization masks can be classified based on their specific design features and functionalities.
