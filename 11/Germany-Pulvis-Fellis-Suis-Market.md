One significant category is powdered bile, which is derived from the bile of pigs. This form is often utilized in pharmaceutical and therapeutic applications, especially for conditions related to liver function and digestion. The powdered bile can be processed to ensure consistency and purity, making it a versatile ingredient for various medical products. Due to the increasing focus on natural and organic remedies in Germany, powdered bile has gained significant popularity in the market, as it offers a more natural alternative to synthetic substances in healthcare formulations.

Liquid bile extracts are widely used in digestive aids and certain prescription medications due to their potent bioactive compounds. The liquid form offers more immediate bioavailability compared to the powdered variant, making it a preferred choice for specific medical treatments. This segment is driven by the growing trend of personalized medicine, where tailored treatments are becoming more common. Additionally, liquid Pulvis Fellis Suis is gaining traction among manufacturers of high-end nutraceuticals and health supplements. The versatility of liquid bile extracts allows for a broader range of applications, contributing to the overall expansion of the Pulvis Fellis Suis market in Germany.
