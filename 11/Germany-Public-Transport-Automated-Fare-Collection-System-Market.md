Contactless cards, which use RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology, have become the dominant choice for commuters due to their convenience and speed. These cards allow passengers to tap in and out of stations without the need for physical contact with ticketing machines. This method enhances the efficiency of fare collection processes, reduces waiting times, and provides seamless travel experiences. Furthermore, the widespread adoption of contactless cards in Germany has contributed to an increase in their usage across various transport modes, including buses, trams, and trains, making them a key player in the market.<p>On the other hand, mobile-based ticketing solutions are gaining traction, particularly among tech-savvy commuters who prefer the convenience of using their smartphones for fare collection. These systems allow users to purchase and store tickets on their mobile devices, which can then be scanned at transport stations for validation. Mobile-based solutions offer flexibility, real-time updates, and integration with other services like route planning. As smartphones become more integrated into daily life, this segment of the market is expected to grow significantly.
