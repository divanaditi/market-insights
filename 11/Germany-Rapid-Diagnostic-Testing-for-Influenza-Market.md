The major categories include molecular tests, antigen tests, and others such as immunoassays. Molecular tests, including PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) tests, are gaining popularity due to their high accuracy and ability to detect the virus at an early stage. These tests offer quicker results compared to traditional laboratory methods, making them crucial in managing influenza outbreaks. The demand for molecular tests is expected to rise, especially in healthcare facilities that prioritize early and accurate detection. As a result, this segment is projected to dominate the market due to its superior sensitivity and specificity in identifying influenza viruses, contributing to timely patient care and intervention.<p>On the other hand, antigen-based tests are also widely used due to their ease of use and affordability. These tests provide results in a matter of minutes, making them ideal for point-of-care settings such as clinics and doctor's offices. Although antigen tests offer a faster turnaround time, their accuracy may be lower compared to molecular tests, leading to their use in less critical cases or when speed is prioritized over high sensitivity. The continued adoption of antigen tests is expected to drive growth in the rapid diagnostic testing market, particularly in rural and underserved areas where access to advanced laboratory infrastructure is limited.
