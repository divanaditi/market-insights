One of the primary categories is formal early education, which includes structured programs provided by educational institutions such as preschools, daycare centers, and kindergartens. These programs focus on early childhood development, including cognitive, motor, and social skills, with a curriculum designed to prepare children for primary school. The demand for formal education is driven by the increasing awareness of the importance of early childhood education in shaping a child's future academic success and social abilities. Additionally, government initiatives and policies have contributed to the widespread adoption of these services, making them more accessible to families across the country.</p><p>Another significant segment is informal early learning services, which encompass a wide range of non-institutional offerings, including playgroups, parental education, and home-based learning. These services are often flexible and more personalized, allowing children to engage in learning experiences that may include art, music, physical activities, and social interaction in informal settings.
