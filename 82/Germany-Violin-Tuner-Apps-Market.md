Mobile applications are the dominant segment, driven by the increasing use of smartphones among musicians. These apps offer portability and ease of access, allowing violinists to tune their instruments on the go.

As smartphone technology continues to advance, the demand for high-performance, reliable mobile tuner apps is expected to grow, catering to a broad spectrum of violin players across Germany.</p><p>On the other hand, desktop applications, although a smaller segment, still hold relevance for users who prefer more detailed tuning options and features.
