One major category includes pump filters, which utilize a manual pumping mechanism to force water through the filtration media. These filters are known for their reliability and are commonly used by backpackers who need to filter large quantities of water in remote locations. Another popular type is the gravity filters, which work by utilizing gravity to pull water through a filter bag into a clean water reservoir. These filters are particularly favored for their ease of use, as they do not require physical effort. Additionally, there are inline filters that attach directly to hydration systems or water bottles, offering portability and efficiency for quick filtration on the go. This variety in filtration technologies caters to the diverse preferences of outdoor enthusiasts in Germany. </p><p>Another important category in the market includes straw-style filters, which allow users to drink directly from water sources.
