Natural polysaccharides, such as chitosan and cellulose derivatives, are widely used due to their biocompatibility, ease of application, and effectiveness in controlling bleeding. These agents are derived from natural sources like crustacean shells and plant-based materials, providing a safer and more sustainable option for wound care. Their popularity is further driven by their ability to promote rapid hemostasis, making them highly preferred in various medical applications, especially in trauma care and surgical procedures. The demand for natural polysaccharides is expected to grow due to the increasing preference for organic materials in medical products.On the other hand, synthetic polysaccharides are gaining traction in the German market due to their customizable properties and longer shelf life. These synthetic agents are engineered to offer more controlled hemostatic effects and can be produced in large quantities with consistent quality. They are often used in specialized medical treatments, such as in orthopedic and cardiovascular surgeries, where precision in blood clotting is crucial. Synthetic polysaccharides can be modified to enhance their interaction with the body’s clotting mechanisms, offering a versatile solution in the field of hemostasis.
