DMPs offer superior sound quality, touchscreen interfaces, and the ability to support a wide range of audio and video formats. Many of these devices are equipped with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, enabling users to stream music from various online platforms. Additionally, DMPs often feature more advanced functionalities, such as larger storage capacities, cloud integration, and compatibility with various apps, which appeal to tech-savvy consumers. This segment has witnessed growth as multimedia content consumption continues to rise, and consumers seek devices that can provide both audio and video experiences.
