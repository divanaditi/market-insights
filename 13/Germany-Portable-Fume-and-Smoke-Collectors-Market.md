The primary segment consists of electrostatic precipitators, which are widely utilized for removing particulate matter and fumes from industrial emissions. These devices use electric fields to trap smoke and dust particles, making them highly efficient in environments with high levels of particulate pollution. Due to their low maintenance costs and effective performance, electrostatic precipitators dominate the market, particularly in industries such as manufacturing, food processing, and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, these collectors are known for their ability to operate in harsh conditions, contributing to their increased adoption in Germany’s industrial sector.<p>Another key segment in the market is mechanical filters, which are designed to capture both fumes and particulates from the air using physical barriers. These filters are particularly popular in environments where fine particulate matter and vapors are a concern, such as welding, automotive, and metalworking industries. Mechanical filters typically include options like HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters, which provide superior filtration capabilities, ensuring that harmful smoke and dust are effectively removed from the workspace.
