Chewable tablets are gaining popularity due to their convenience and ease of use, particularly among children and adults who prefer a straightforward, no-mess option for incorporating probiotics into their daily routine. These tablets often come in a variety of flavors, which makes them more appealing to consumers. Chewable tablets are also favored for their portability, allowing individuals to take them on the go without the need for mixing or preparation. The demand for these tablets is expected to increase as awareness about oral health and the benefits of probiotics continues to grow in Germany.</p><p>On the other hand, powder-form probiotics are also gaining traction in the market due to their versatility. These powders can be easily mixed with water, smoothies, or other beverages, offering a customizable dosage and flavor options. Powder probiotics are particularly popular among consumers who are looking for higher concentrations of active ingredients and more flexibility in their supplement intake. This type of probiotic supplement is also widely used by individuals who prioritize natural or holistic health solutions.
