Another key segment is dental crowns and bridges, which are designed to restore both the function and aesthetics of teeth. These high-value consumables are crafted using advanced materials such as zirconia, porcelain, and metal alloys, offering long-lasting results. The demand for these products continues to rise due to the increasing number of dental procedures, fueled by an aging population and greater awareness of oral health.
