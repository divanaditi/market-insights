One of the major segments is non-surgical treatments, which include physical therapy, medications, and injections. Physical therapy plays a vital role in alleviating symptoms, strengthening the muscles around the spine, and improving mobility. Medications, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are commonly prescribed to reduce inflammation and manage pain. Additionally, corticosteroid injections are used to provide targeted relief from pain and inflammation caused by degenerative disc disease. These non-invasive treatments are generally preferred by patients who seek pain management without undergoing surgery and are often the first-line approach for managing the condition.<p>On the other hand, surgical treatments are another critical segment of the market for managing degenerative disc disease in Germany. Surgical options include spinal fusion and artificial disc replacement, both of which aim to restore spinal function and alleviate chronic pain. Spinal fusion involves the joining of two or more vertebrae to reduce movement and relieve pain, while artificial disc replacement offers a less invasive option by replacing the damaged disc with a prosthetic one. Both surgical procedures are often recommended for patients whose condition does not improve with conservative treatments or who experience severe symptoms. The decision between surgical and non-surgical treatments typically depends on the severity of the condition, the patient’s age, and overall health.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/668002/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Degenerative Disc Disease Treatment Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Degenerative Disc Disease Treatment Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Degenerative Disc Disease Treatment Market size was valued at USD 4.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 7.1 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.9% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Degenerative Disc Disease Treatment Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Medtronic</Li><Li> Globus Medical Inc</Li><Li> Johnson & Johnson</Li><Li> Zimmer Biomet</Li><Li> B.
