The cellulose-based liquid wallpaper is especially popular for its eco-friendly characteristics and versatility, as it can be applied to a variety of surfaces, offering easy maintenance and long-lasting results. Additionally, the decorative patterns and colors available in this segment enhance the overall visual impact, making it a preferred choice for high-end interiors and custom designs.<p>Another significant segment in the market is the synthetic fiber-based liquid wallpaper, which is gaining traction due to its superior strength and resistance to wear and tear.
