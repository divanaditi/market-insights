One of the key segments is the tablet form, which remains the most widely consumed type due to its ease of use and precise dosage control. Tablets are typically available in various strengths, catering to different patient needs, from mild to more severe cases. These are preferred for their convenience and long shelf-life, which make them ideal for widespread distribution in pharmacies. Another segment gaining traction is the liquid formulation, which is primarily prescribed for patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets, such as the elderly or children. Liquid Osutidine allows for flexible dosing and is considered more versatile for certain medical conditions where precise titration of the dose is required.<p>In addition to these, injectable Osutidine is another significant segment within the market.
