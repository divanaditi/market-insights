Fabric bags, such as cotton and jute, are gaining popularity due to their durability and reusability, offering a more environmentally responsible alternative to plastic. These bags are preferred by consumers looking for sustainable options in both retail and personal use, contributing to the growth of this segment in the craft bags market. <p>Plastic craft bags, although facing scrutiny due to environmental concerns, continue to be used in certain applications due to their lightweight and cost-effective nature.
