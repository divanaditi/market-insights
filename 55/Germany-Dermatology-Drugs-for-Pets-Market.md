One of the primary categories includes corticosteroids, which are widely used to treat inflammatory skin diseases like dermatitis and allergic reactions in pets. These drugs help in reducing swelling, redness, and itching. Antifungals are another significant segment, effective against skin infections caused by fungi such as ringworm. These drugs help in treating fungal infections on the pet’s skin, preventing further spread. Additionally, antibiotics for bacterial infections are critical in managing wounds, abscesses, and infections, providing relief and promoting healing. Topical treatments, such as medicated shampoos, creams, and ointments, also contribute to the market, offering localized care to pets with skin conditions.</p><p>Another key segment of dermatology drugs for pets includes antihistamines, which are used to treat itching caused by allergies, insect bites, or environmental factors.
