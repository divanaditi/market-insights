The most common types include activated carbon filters, ion exchange filters, and reverse osmosis filters. Activated carbon filters are widely used due to their ability to effectively remove chlorine, sediment, and other contaminants, improving the taste and odor of water. These filters are typically more affordable and convenient for everyday use. Ion exchange filters are another popular choice as they efficiently reduce hardness in water, removing minerals such as calcium and magnesium, which can cause scale buildup in pipes and appliances. The reverse osmosis filters are gaining popularity in the German market for their ability to remove a wider range of contaminants, including heavy metals and bacteria, offering an advanced level of purification, though they tend to be more expensive and require higher maintenance.<p>Another emerging trend in the market is the growing preference for multi-stage filtration systems, which combine various types of filtering technologies to provide a more comprehensive purification process. These multi-stage pitchers are designed to target a broader range of impurities, ensuring that the water is purified to a higher standard. In addition to conventional filtration methods, there is an increasing interest in pitchers with filters that use activated carbon combined with mineralization filters. These pitchers not only purify the water but also add essential minerals, improving the overall health benefits.
