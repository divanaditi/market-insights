Another significant segment includes engineered glued parquet floors, which feature multiple layers of wood and are designed to be more resistant to changes in temperature and humidity, making them ideal for areas with fluctuating climates.

These floors offer superior resistance to warping and are perfect for regions with challenging weather conditions. This segment is particularly favored for both residential and commercial applications that demand high-quality flooring solutions at a more affordable price point. Furthermore, the market also includes a variety of surface finishes, such as matte, gloss, and oil treatments, allowing for customization based on consumer taste.
