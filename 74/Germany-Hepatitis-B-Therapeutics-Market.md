Antiviral drugs are the most commonly used treatment option, offering effective control over viral replication. These drugs, such as nucleos(t)ide analogs, help suppress the virus, prevent progression to cirrhosis, and reduce the risk of liver cancer. They are highly preferred due to their long-term efficacy, ease of administration, and relatively low side effect profile. The increasing number of diagnosed hepatitis B cases and the growing awareness about the importance of early treatment have fueled the demand for antiviral drugs in Germany. Moreover, the emergence of new, more potent antiviral medications is expected to further drive market growth in the coming years.<p>On the other hand, interferon-based therapies, including pegylated interferon, have a distinct role in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. These therapies are less commonly used due to their side effects and need for regular injections, but they can lead to a functional cure in some patients. Interferon-based treatments stimulate the immune system to fight the virus and are often recommended for specific patient groups, such as those with high viral loads or patients who are not responsive to antiviral drugs. Although the use of interferon has declined in favor of oral antiviral drugs, it remains an important segment in the Germany Hepatitis B therapeutics market, especially in cases where other treatments are less effective or inappropriate.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/820008/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Hepatitis B Therapeutics Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Hepatitis B Therapeutics Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Hepatitis B Therapeutics Market size was valued at USD 4.73 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 8.88 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 8.6% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Hepatitis B Therapeutics Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>GlaxoSmithKline</Li><Li> Bristol-Myers Squibb</Li><Li> Novira Therapeutics</Li><Li> Johnson & Johnson</Li><Li> Abivax</Li><Li> F.
