Medications used for symptom management often focus on alleviating dry mouth, dry eyes, and joint pain. These treatments typically include anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants. Artificial tears, saliva substitutes, and oral lubricants are also frequently used to reduce discomfort associated with the syndrome. These therapies help control symptoms but do not address the underlying autoimmune causes of Sjögren’s syndrome. Given the chronic nature of the disease, symptom management remains a key focus in the therapeutic market, enabling patients to maintain their quality of life while managing the condition's persistent effects. <p>On the other hand, disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) aim to target the root causes of Sjögren’s syndrome by modulating the immune system. These treatments often include biologics, such as monoclonal antibodies, and targeted therapies that can slow disease progression or reduce autoimmunity. Disease-modifying treatments are typically recommended for patients with severe forms of the disease, where the immune system’s dysfunction causes significant organ damage or life-threatening complications. The use of DMTs is expected to grow as research advances in understanding the mechanisms of Sjögren’s syndrome. As the market evolves, the demand for biologics and other innovative therapies is anticipated to rise, offering patients more effective options for long-term disease management and improved outcomes.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/815256/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Sjogrenâ€™s Syndrome Therapeutics Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Sjogrenâ€™s Syndrome Therapeutics Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Sjogrenâ€™s Syndrome Therapeutics Market size was valued at USD 1.2 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.5 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 9.8% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Sjogrenâ€™s Syndrome Therapeutics Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Allergan</Li><Li> Biogen</Li><Li> Bristol-Myers Squibb</Li><Li> F.
