Anti-VEGF therapies dominate the market due to their efficacy in preventing disease progression. These therapies work by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein responsible for abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina. Common drugs in this category include ranibizumab, aflibercept, and bevacizumab, which are widely prescribed for their ability to reduce macular edema and improve visual outcomes. The adoption of Anti-VEGF therapies in Germany has surged due to their proven effectiveness, safety profile, and the increasing incidence of wet AMD in the aging population. Furthermore, ongoing research and advancements in drug formulations are expected to further enhance the market for Anti-VEGF treatments in the near future.</p><p>On the other hand, photodynamic therapy (PDT) is another treatment approach used in the wet AMD market. PDT involves the administration of a photosensitive drug, followed by exposure to laser light to activate the drug and destroy abnormal blood vessels in the retina. Though its use has decreased with the rise of Anti-VEGF therapies, PDT still holds a place in the treatment regimen, particularly for patients who do not respond well to the latter. Photodynamic therapy can be effective in stabilizing vision and slowing disease progression, especially in specific types of wet AMD. While its market share has diminished, PDT is still relevant in certain clinical settings, particularly where Anti-VEGF options may not be suitable due to patient-specific factors. The ongoing refinement of PDT techniques may further extend its application within the German wet AMD market.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/822488/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Wet Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Wet Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Wet Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) Market size was valued at USD 9.85 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 16.43 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.8% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Wet Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Novartis International (Switzerland)</Li><Li> Bayer (Germany)</Li><Li> Acucela (US)</Li><Li> Neurotech Pharmaceuticals (US)</Li><Li> Ophthotech (US)</Li><Li> GlaxoSmithKline (US)</Li><Li> Alimera Sciences (US)</Li><Li> StemCell (Canada)</Li><Li> F.
