Expanded foam glass aggregates are characterized by their lightweight and insulating properties, making them ideal for use in applications such as thermal insulation, drainage systems, and landscaping. These aggregates are produced by heating recycled glass in a controlled environment to create small, bubble-like structures. The unique structure of expanded foam glass aggregates provides excellent thermal and sound insulation, which is driving their demand in the construction and building industries. With a growing focus on sustainability and the reduction of construction waste, expanded foam glass aggregates are becoming increasingly popular for eco-friendly building solutions across Germany.<p>Crushed foam glass aggregates are another important type in the German market. These aggregates are created by crushing expanded foam glass into smaller particles, making them suitable for use in concrete, road construction, and as a filler material. The primary advantage of crushed foam glass aggregates lies in their ability to enhance the mechanical properties of concrete while maintaining a reduced environmental footprint. Their low density and high durability make them ideal for improving the strength and longevity of various infrastructure projects.
