One of the primary segments includes the simple rectovaginal fistula, which typically results from childbirth trauma or surgical complications. This type of fistula is relatively easier to treat, with many cases being managed through conservative methods or minor surgical interventions. Another significant segment is the complex rectovaginal fistula, often associated with conditions such as Crohn's disease, cancer, or radiotherapy. These types of fistulas require more intricate surgical procedures and long-term management strategies. The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, along with advancements in surgical techniques, has led to a steady rise in the demand for specialized treatments for complex cases. This has spurred growth in the market for rectovaginal fistula therapies across Germany, particularly in healthcare institutions with advanced surgical capabilities.</p><p>Another critical segment within the market includes the recurrent rectovaginal fistula, a condition where the fistula reappears after initial treatment.
