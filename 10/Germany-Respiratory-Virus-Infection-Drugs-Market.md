Antiviral drugs are used to inhibit the replication of viruses and reduce the severity of respiratory infections caused by viruses like influenza, RSV, and coronaviruses. These drugs include both prescription antiviral medications and over-the-counter options, which are widely utilized in treating various viral respiratory infections. As Germany continues to focus on improving healthcare systems and pandemic preparedness, antiviral treatments are gaining prominence, with innovations in drug formulations leading to more effective therapies. Furthermore, these drugs are increasingly used in both inpatient and outpatient settings, driving their demand within the market.</p><p>Vaccines form the second major category in the respiratory virus infection drugs market. Vaccination is a preventive measure to protect individuals from viral infections like the flu or COVID-19. In recent years, with the rapid spread of novel viruses, the importance of vaccines has become more pronounced. The German government and healthcare providers have prioritized the development and distribution of vaccines to control the spread of respiratory viruses. Public awareness of the effectiveness of vaccines in reducing infection rates and severe complications has boosted demand, especially for flu and COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, continuous advancements in vaccine technologies, including mRNA-based platforms, are further supporting the growth of this segment in Germany's respiratory virus infection drugs market.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/325036/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Respiratory Virus Infection Drugs Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Respiratory Virus Infection Drugs Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Respiratory Virus Infection Drugs Market Market size was valued at USD 5.2 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 9.8 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 8.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Respiratory Virus Infection Drugs Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>GlaxoSmithKline plc</Li><Li> Merck and Co.</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> AstraZeneca</Li><Li> Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH</Li><Li> F.
