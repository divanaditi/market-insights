Injectable forms of the drug are generally administered under the supervision of healthcare professionals in clinical or hospital settings. This form of Tazemetostat is preferred in specific therapeutic contexts, such as when rapid or more controlled absorption is necessary. Injectable formulations are also used in clinical trials or for patients with certain medical conditions where oral intake might not be feasible.
