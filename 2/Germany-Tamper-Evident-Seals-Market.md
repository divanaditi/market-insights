One of the prominent types is the adhesive seals, which are widely used in sectors like pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, and logistics. These seals provide a simple and effective method of ensuring product integrity, offering a clear indication if tampering has occurred. Additionally, adhesive seals are cost-effective and versatile, making them a popular choice for businesses that need to ensure secure packaging without adding significant costs. These seals are particularly favored in packaging processes where ease of application and reliable protection are essential.</p><p>Another major segment in the German tamper evident seals market is the breakable seals. These seals are designed to break or deform when tampered with, providing an obvious visual cue of potential security breaches. Breakable seals are commonly utilized in industries such as transportation, automotive, and high-value goods shipping, where protection against theft or unauthorized access is crucial. Their robustness and clear indication of tampering make them ideal for securing sensitive items, as they offer higher security levels compared to traditional seals.
