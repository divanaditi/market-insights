Passive safety syringes are designed to engage the safety feature automatically once the injection is completed. These devices are favored for their ease of use, especially in high-volume healthcare settings where efficiency and speed are crucial. They help to reduce the risk of needle-stick injuries, which is a significant concern in hospitals and clinics. Passive safety syringes are expected to maintain a strong market share due to their cost-effectiveness and minimal user intervention, which enhances workplace safety and reduces the likelihood of accidental needle exposure.</p><p>Active safety syringes, on the other hand, require the user to activate the safety feature manually, typically by pushing a button or triggering a mechanism once the injection is administered. These devices provide a higher degree of control for healthcare professionals and are often used in situations where a more deliberate approach to safety is necessary. The active safety syringe segment is anticipated to see significant growth due to increasing awareness of healthcare worker safety and the implementation of stricter safety regulations across healthcare facilities. Both types of safety syringes cater to distinct needs, thereby contributing to the overall expansion of the market in Germany.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/266890/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Syringe Safety Device Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Syringe Safety Device Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Syringe Safety Device Market size was valued at USD 2.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 5.1 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 9.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Syringe Safety Device Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>BD</Li><Li> ICU Medical</Li><Li> Equashield</Li><Li> Teva Pharmaceutical Industries</Li><Li> Corvida Medical</Li><Li> B.
