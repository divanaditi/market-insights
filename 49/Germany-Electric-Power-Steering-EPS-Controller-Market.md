Column Assist EPS is widely adopted in smaller vehicles, offering a compact and cost-effective solution. This type of EPS utilizes an electric motor integrated into the steering column, providing torque assistance directly to the steering wheel. It is generally preferred in compact and mid-size cars due to its simplified design and space-saving benefits. With the growing demand for energy efficiency and lightweight solutions in modern vehicles, Column Assist EPS has gained popularity in the German automotive market. Furthermore, advancements in motor and sensor technology have improved its performance and reliability, driving its increasing adoption across various vehicle segments in Germany.<p>On the other hand, Pinion Assist EPS is more commonly found in larger vehicles, including SUVs and premium cars, due to its ability to deliver more precise steering control and greater responsiveness at higher speeds. This system uses an electric motor that is mounted on the pinion gear, directly aiding in the steering mechanism. Pinion Assist EPS is known for its high efficiency and durability, making it ideal for vehicles requiring a more robust steering system. The rise in demand for premium vehicles in Germany, coupled with a shift towards electric and hybrid vehicles, has spurred the growth of the Pinion Assist EPS market. Both types of EPS controllers play a significant role in enhancing driving comfort and vehicle performance in the evolving automotive landscape of Germany.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/617378/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Electric Power Steering (EPS) Controller Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Electric Power Steering (EPS) Controller Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Electric Power Steering (EPS) Controller Market size was valued at USD 8.45 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 13.21 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.52% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Electric Power Steering (EPS) Controller Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Jingwei Hirain</Li><Li> Bosch</Li><Li> JTEKT</Li><Li> Nexteer</Li><Li> ZF</Li><Li> NSK</Li><Li> Hitachi Astemo (Showa)</Li><Li> Hyundai Mobis</Li><Li> Thyssenkrupp</Li><Li> Mando</Li><Li> CAAS</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Electric Power Steering (EPS) Controller Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Electric Power Steering (EPS) Controller Market apart.
