Brushed motors have traditionally been used in EPS systems due to their cost-effectiveness and simplicity in design. These motors are commonly found in lower-end vehicle models, where the demand for high torque and efficiency is moderate. Brushed motors are driven by electrical commutation and are characterized by their relatively lower cost and easier integration into steering systems. However, these motors have a limited lifespan due to wear and tear of brushes, which can impact their long-term reliability. Despite these drawbacks, their affordability continues to make them a viable option in the automotive sector, particularly in budget-friendly vehicles.<p>On the other hand, brushless motors are gaining significant traction in the German EPS motor market, especially in premium and electric vehicles. Brushless motors offer superior performance, higher torque, and greater durability compared to their brushed counterparts, as they do not rely on brushes for commutation. This results in reduced wear and a longer operational life. Additionally, brushless motors are more energy-efficient, making them ideal for electric and hybrid vehicles, which prioritize energy conservation. As the demand for more advanced, high-performance steering systems increases, brushless motors are expected to dominate the market in the coming years, driven by their superior efficiency and minimal maintenance requirements. The shift towards these motors is also supported by ongoing technological advancements in motor design and automotive engineering.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/617346/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Electric Power Steering System Motor Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Electric Power Steering System Motor Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Electric Power Steering System Motor Market size was valued at USD 23.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 36.4 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Electric Power Steering System Motor Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Nidec</Li><Li> Bosch</Li><Li> Mitsubishi Electric</Li><Li> Denso</Li><Li> ZF</Li><Li> LG Innotek</Li><Li> Mitsuba</Li><Li> Mahle</Li><Li> Elite</Li><Li> Dare Auto</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Electric Power Steering System Motor Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Electric Power Steering System Motor Market apart.
