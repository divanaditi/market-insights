Contact-based sensors are traditional devices that rely on mechanical contacts for detecting torque. These sensors are generally simpler in design and are often more cost-effective. However, they tend to wear out over time due to friction, which can lead to reduced accuracy and reliability. Despite this drawback, contact-based torque sensors are still commonly used in applications where cost efficiency is a priority and the steering system operates in less demanding conditions. These sensors are typically found in older vehicle models or in budget-conscious vehicle segments, where durability is less of a concern.<p>On the other hand, contactless torque sensors are gaining traction in the market due to their higher precision and longer lifespan. These sensors operate without any physical contact, thus minimizing wear and tear. Contactless sensors are based on technologies such as magnetic or optical sensing, offering more accurate torque measurement and better overall performance in modern electric power steering systems. They are increasingly preferred in high-end and newer vehicle models, where reliability and advanced features like adaptive steering and enhanced driver assistance systems are required. As the demand for higher performance and durability in EPS systems increases, the adoption of contactless sensors is expected to continue growing, further driving the market's evolution in Germany.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/617366/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Electric Power Steering (EPS) Torque Sensor Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Electric Power Steering (EPS) Torque Sensor Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Electric Power Steering (EPS) Torque Sensor Market size was valued at USD 2.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 4.0 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.0% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Electric Power Steering (EPS) Torque Sensor Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Robert Bosch</Li><Li> HL Klemove</Li><Li> Bourns</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> Proterial</Li><Li> Ltd.</Li><Li> Methode Electronics</Li><Li> Vision Technology</Li><Li> TT Electronics</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Electric Power Steering (EPS) Torque Sensor Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Electric Power Steering (EPS) Torque Sensor Market apart.
