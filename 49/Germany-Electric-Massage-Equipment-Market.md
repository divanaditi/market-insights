Handheld massagers are gaining popularity due to their portability, ease of use, and affordability. These devices are suitable for targeting specific areas of the body and offer a convenient solution for individuals seeking relief from muscle tension or stress. The growth in consumer preference for at-home wellness products has contributed to the increasing demand for handheld massagers. Furthermore, advancements in technology have enhanced the functionality of these devices, with features such as adjustable speed settings and heat functions, making them more effective and appealing to a wider range of consumers.</p><p>Massage chairs, on the other hand, are positioned as premium products in the market. These chairs provide a full-body massage experience and are equipped with various massage techniques, including kneading, rolling, and shiatsu. They are designed to offer a luxurious experience and cater to individuals seeking long-term relaxation and pain relief. The higher price point of massage chairs often appeals to those willing to invest in long-lasting wellness solutions.
