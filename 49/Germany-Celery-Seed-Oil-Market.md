Organic celery seed oil is often used in various industries such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and aromatherapy. The demand for this product is driven by its perceived health benefits, such as anti-inflammatory properties and antioxidant effects, which make it ideal for skincare and wellness applications.</p><p>On the other hand, conventional celery seed oil remains a dominant segment in the market.
