These transducers include both linear and convex phased array probes, which are used in medical imaging and industrial inspections. Linear phased array transducers offer high-resolution imaging and are commonly utilized in applications requiring clear and detailed images, such as musculoskeletal and small parts imaging. On the other hand, convex phased array transducers, with a broader field of view, are typically employed for deeper tissue imaging, such as in cardiology and obstetrics. Both types are essential in providing accurate and efficient diagnostic information across a range of healthcare and industrial sectors. The growth of the market is driven by the increasing demand for non-invasive diagnostic tools and advancements in ultrasound technology that improve image quality and penetration depth in clinical settings.</p><p>In addition to linear and convex transducers, the market also features sectoral and matrix phased array transducers, each serving specific purposes within the diagnostic landscape. Sectoral phased array transducers are known for their compact design and ability to capture images of specific areas quickly, making them suitable for applications like emergency and point-of-care diagnostics. Matrix phased array transducers, with their ability to offer 3D imaging capabilities, are particularly valuable in complex imaging scenarios, such as in vascular and cardiac imaging.
