Organic PCMs are widely used due to their excellent thermal performance and cost-effectiveness. These materials typically exhibit a higher latent heat capacity, which makes them ideal for applications requiring efficient thermal management. Organic PCMs include paraffins and fatty acids, which offer high thermal conductivity and are compatible with various substrates. Their ability to undergo a phase change within a narrow temperature range makes them suitable for thermal control in devices such as LED lighting, electronics, and power semiconductors. The widespread adoption of organic PCMs is driven by their availability, ease of processing, and compatibility with diverse applications, further fueling their dominance in the market.<p>Inorganic phase change materials, on the other hand, are known for their superior thermal conductivity and stability at high temperatures. These materials, such as salts and metal hydrides, are particularly useful in more demanding applications, where high-performance heat management is required. Inorganic PCMs are favored in industries like automotive, aerospace, and industrial electronics due to their ability to operate effectively at higher temperature ranges. These materials can offer improved thermal cycling performance and higher phase change enthalpies compared to organic alternatives.
