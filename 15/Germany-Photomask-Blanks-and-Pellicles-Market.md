One key type is quartz photomask blanks, which are widely used due to their excellent transparency to ultraviolet (UV) light. This type is especially suitable for advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes, where precision and clarity are crucial. Another significant category is glass photomask blanks, offering a lower cost alternative compared to quartz but still providing reliable performance in less demanding photolithography applications. Additionally, there are organic-based photomask blanks, primarily employed in niche applications where lower costs are a priority, but the demands for resolution are not as stringent. These various photomask blanks are tailored to meet specific requirements, ranging from high-performance semiconductor production to more economical solutions for general lithography purposes.</p><p>Pellicles, which are used in photomask manufacturing to protect masks from dust and particles during the exposure process, also exhibit various types in the German market. The most common pellicles are made from thin, transparent films that stretch across the photomask. These pellicles can be categorized into those made from organic and inorganic materials. Organic pellicles, often made from polymer films, are known for their flexibility and cost-effectiveness. In contrast, inorganic pellicles, often made of silica or similar materials, are designed to offer superior durability and resistance to extreme UV exposure. The choice of pellicle type largely depends on the specific lithographic technology used and the level of precision required for the semiconductor devices being manufactured.
