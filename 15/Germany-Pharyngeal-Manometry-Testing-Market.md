The most common type is the Conventional Pharyngeal Manometry, which uses a catheter with pressure sensors to measure the muscular contractions in the pharynx. This method is widely used for diagnosing swallowing disorders, including dysphagia, and for evaluating esophageal motility. It is considered reliable due to its high accuracy and ability to measure pressures during both rest and swallowing phases. Another significant type is the High-Resolution Pharyngeal Manometry (HRM), which provides a detailed, high-resolution map of pressure activity, offering deeper insights into swallowing dysfunctions. HRM is particularly beneficial for patients with complex swallowing problems and those undergoing pre-operative assessments for conditions like achalasia or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).</p><p>In addition to conventional and high-resolution types, the Germany market is also seeing growth in the use of Pharyngeal Manometry combined with other diagnostic tools. This integration helps provide a comprehensive understanding of esophageal conditions, allowing for better treatment planning. For example, the combination of manometry with impedance testing enables the evaluation of bolus transit and reflux episodes.
