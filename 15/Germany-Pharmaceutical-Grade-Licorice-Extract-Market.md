The liquid form allows for quicker absorption and better bioavailability of active ingredients, which is crucial for medicinal efficacy. As demand for natural remedies and alternative medicines continues to rise, liquid licorice extract is gaining popularity in the German market for its versatility and therapeutic benefits. Additionally, liquid extracts offer convenience in dosage, which makes them favorable for consumers seeking easy-to-administer options.</p><p>On the other hand, powdered licorice extract is used in tablets, capsules, and other solid dosage forms, making it another key segment of the market. Powdered extracts are preferred for their long shelf life, ease of storage, and precise dosage control. The solid form of licorice extract is often utilized in dietary supplements and pharmaceutical products targeting digestive health, immune support, and respiratory treatments. With increasing consumer interest in herbal supplements, powdered licorice extract remains a vital component in Germany's growing nutraceutical sector.
