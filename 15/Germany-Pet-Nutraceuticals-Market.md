With increasing awareness of the importance of preventative care for pets, the demand for supplements that promote long-term health is rising. Pet owners are seeking more natural, organic, and scientifically backed supplements to improve their pets' quality of life, contributing to the steady growth of this segment in the market.</p><p>Another significant segment in the market is functional foods, which are specially formulated to provide additional health benefits beyond basic nutrition. These products include fortified pet food items enriched with ingredients that promote digestive health, improve coat quality, and support cardiovascular function.
