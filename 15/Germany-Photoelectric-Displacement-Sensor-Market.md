The key categories include through-beam sensors, retro-reflective sensors, and diffuse reflection sensors. Through-beam sensors are widely used due to their high precision and ability to detect objects over long distances. These sensors typically feature a separate emitter and receiver, which results in accurate displacement measurement, making them ideal for applications requiring high reliability. Retroflective sensors, on the other hand, utilize a single housing for both the emitter and receiver, making them easier to install and maintain. They offer cost-effective solutions for mid-range displacement sensing. Diffuse reflection sensors, which are often employed for short-range measurements, operate by detecting the reflected light from the target object, offering high-speed detection and precision for compact applications. The demand for these sensors varies across different sectors, with specific industries opting for the most suitable type based on their operational needs.</p><p>Through-beam sensors hold a significant share in the market due to their unmatched precision and long-distance capabilities, ideal for industries such as automotive, packaging, and material handling.
