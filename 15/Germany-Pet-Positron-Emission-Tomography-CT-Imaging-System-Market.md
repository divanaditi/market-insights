Standalone PET systems are primarily used for nuclear imaging, providing high-resolution images of metabolic activity in the body. They are widely adopted in hospitals and diagnostic centers for detecting various types of cancers, heart diseases, and neurological disorders. These systems deliver high diagnostic accuracy, which is essential for treatment planning and follow-up evaluations. The standalone PET market continues to grow due to its ability to provide specialized diagnostic imaging in a range of clinical applications. Additionally, the adoption of standalone systems remains prevalent in research settings, offering detailed insights into disease processes.<p>On the other hand, hybrid PET-CT systems combine Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with Computed Tomography (CT) to offer comprehensive imaging solutions that provide both metabolic and anatomical details. This combination allows for superior diagnostic performance, making it a preferred choice for oncology, cardiology, and neurology. The integration of PET and CT enhances the precision of tumor detection, staging, and treatment monitoring. These hybrid systems offer faster scanning times and more accurate results, driving their adoption across hospitals and medical research institutions.
