Vitamins and minerals are among the most widely consumed supplements, as they play a critical role in maintaining pets' overall health and immune system. These supplements help address common nutritional deficiencies in pets, improving their vitality and longevity. Amino acid supplements are also gaining traction, particularly in the care of pets with special dietary needs or those recovering from illnesses. Probiotics are becoming increasingly popular for improving digestive health in pets, while fatty acids are vital for maintaining skin, coat, and joint health. This segmentation shows the growing trend of pet owners prioritizing their pets’ specific health requirements through targeted supplementation for better quality of life.</p><p>The demand for specific types of pet multivitamins and supplements is further driven by an increasing awareness among pet owners regarding the benefits of tailored nutrition.
