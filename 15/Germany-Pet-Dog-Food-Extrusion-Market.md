Dry dog food holds a significant market share due to its convenience, long shelf life, and ease of storage. It is often available in various forms such as kibble, biscuits, and pellets. Dry extruded dog food is preferred by pet owners for its cost-effectiveness and ability to support the overall health of dogs through balanced nutrients. The extrusion process involves high heat and pressure, which helps in maintaining the food's nutritional integrity while enhancing digestibility. This category is expected to continue dominating the market, driven by increasing pet adoption rates and rising demand for specialized dog food formulations catering to various breeds and health requirements. <p>Wet dog food is also gaining traction in the German market, as it offers superior palatability and hydration benefits. This segment includes products such as canned or pouched food, which often contains higher moisture content compared to dry food. Wet extruded dog food is considered a premium option, as it typically uses higher-quality ingredients and is perceived as fresher and more appetizing for dogs. Additionally, the growing trend of pet humanization is influencing the market, with pet owners opting for wet food to provide their pets with more variety and better taste. Although the wet food segment is comparatively smaller than the dry food segment, it is witnessing steady growth due to the increasing number of health-conscious pet owners in Germany seeking more nutritious and flavorful options for their dogs.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/370660/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Pet Dog Food Extrusion Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Pet Dog Food Extrusion Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Pet Dog Food Extrusion Market size was valued at USD 5.6 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 9.3 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.0% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Pet Dog Food Extrusion Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Mars</Li><Li> NestlÃ©</Li><Li> J.M.
