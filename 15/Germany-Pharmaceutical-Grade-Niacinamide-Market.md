The powder segment holds a dominant share in the market due to its high stability, ease of storage, and versatility in various pharmaceutical applications. Powdered niacinamide is widely used in the manufacturing of oral tablets, capsules, and topical formulations, offering precise dosing and longer shelf life. Additionally, the powder form is often preferred in the production of dermatological products, where stability is critical to maintaining efficacy over time. With advancements in formulation technology, the demand for powdered niacinamide continues to rise across different pharmaceutical sectors, fueling its growth in the market.On the other hand, the liquid niacinamide segment is witnessing steady growth, primarily driven by its easy incorporation into liquid-based pharmaceutical formulations such as creams, serums, and ointments. Liquid niacinamide is popular for topical applications, providing rapid absorption and high bioavailability. The flexibility of liquid formulations allows for enhanced consumer acceptance, particularly in skincare products, where consistency and texture are crucial.
