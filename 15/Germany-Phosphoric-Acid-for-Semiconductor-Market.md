High-purity phosphoric acid is highly sought after, particularly in the production of semiconductor wafers, where precision and cleanliness are essential. This type of phosphoric acid is refined to remove impurities that could interfere with the integrity of semiconductor materials. It is mainly used to clean silicon wafers, remove organic contaminants, and prepare surfaces for subsequent deposition processes. The demand for high-purity phosphoric acid has surged in recent years as the semiconductor industry continues to evolve, driven by advancements in microelectronics and the need for more efficient and powerful devices. As such, the supply chain has had to accommodate these specific requirements to meet the growing demands of semiconductor manufacturers in Germany.</p><p>Another key type of phosphoric acid used in the semiconductor market is industrial-grade phosphoric acid. Although not as pure as its high-purity counterpart, industrial-grade phosphoric acid is employed in other less stringent applications within the semiconductor manufacturing process, such as in cleaning, etching, and other chemical treatments where ultra-high purity is not critical. This type is typically used in bulk and offers a cost-effective solution for large-scale semiconductor production processes. As Germany continues to invest in its semiconductor manufacturing capabilities, industrial-grade phosphoric acid remains essential in meeting the operational needs of these facilities.
