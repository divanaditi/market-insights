Smart bulbs are increasingly popular due to their energy-saving properties and the growing trend of home automation. They appeal to tech-savvy consumers who want to enhance the functionality and ambiance of their living spaces through smartphone-controlled lighting solutions.</p><p>On the other hand, retrofit bulbs represent an important segment of the market, offering a cost-effective solution for upgrading traditional lighting systems. These bulbs are designed to be installed in existing fixtures without the need for extensive modifications. Retrofit bulbs can be controlled via smartphones using external smart hubs or compatible devices, giving consumers an easy entry point into the smart lighting ecosystem. This segment is attractive to budget-conscious consumers who are looking for a simple way to add smart capabilities to their homes without replacing entire lighting systems.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/291526/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Smartphone-controlled Bulb Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Smartphone-controlled Bulb Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Smartphone-controlled Bulb Market size was valued at USD 3.2 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 8.4 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 15.3% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Smartphone-controlled Bulb Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Ams-OSRAM AG</Li><Li> Signify</Li><Li> Acuity Brands</Li><Li> Savant Systems Inc.
