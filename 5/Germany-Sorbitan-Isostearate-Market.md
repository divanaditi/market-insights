The most common types include the standard grade and high-performance grade, each serving distinct sectors such as personal care, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. Standard grade sorbitan isostearate is widely utilized in the formulation of emulsifiers, moisturizers, and other skincare products due to its cost-effectiveness and reliable performance. On the other hand, high-performance grade sorbitan isostearate is preferred in premium products where higher stability, enhanced texture, and skin compatibility are required.

For instance, some formulations are developed with unique properties to cater to the needs of the food industry, providing efficient emulsification in processed foods, confectioneries, and beverages. Additionally, the pharmaceutical industry demands sorbitan isostearate that meets rigorous regulatory standards, ensuring compatibility with drug delivery systems and maintaining product stability. These diverse types of sorbitan isostearate enable manufacturers to meet the specific requirements of their target markets, resulting in a highly segmented market in Germany.
