These sprays cater to a wide range of footwear, including leather, suede, fabric, and synthetic materials. Leather waterproof sprays are particularly popular, as they provide a high level of protection against water and stains while preserving the quality and texture of the material. Additionally, sprays formulated for fabric sneakers are gaining traction due to their ability to prevent moisture penetration while maintaining the breathability and comfort of the shoes. The demand for specialized waterproofing solutions has increased as consumers seek tailored products that ensure optimal protection for different sneaker types.</p><p>Another significant segment within the market is the differentiation based on the spray's characteristics, such as long-lasting and quick-drying formulations.
