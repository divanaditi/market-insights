Cotton, especially Egyptian cotton, dominates the segment due to its softness, durability, and breathable properties. This type of fabric is widely sought after for its premium quality and comfort, offering a smooth and luxurious feel. Additionally, silk and satin sheets have gained popularity among high-end consumers seeking ultimate luxury, known for their silky texture and luster. These fabrics are generally used in premium hotel chains and luxury residential settings where both aesthetics and comfort are paramount. Other fabrics such as linen and bamboo are also part of the segment, known for their eco-friendly attributes and natural cooling effects, appealing to the environmentally conscious consumer looking for sustainable luxury bedding options.<p>The segment also includes microfiber and satin blends that combine the best of both worlds—softness and durability with a shiny, elegant appearance. Microfiber is gaining traction due to its affordability and easy maintenance, offering a practical yet luxurious alternative for budget-conscious consumers. Additionally, velvet sheets are emerging in the luxury segment for their plush texture and distinctive look.
