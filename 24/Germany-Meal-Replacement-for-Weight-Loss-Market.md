Additionally, powder-based meal replacements often come in a wide variety of flavors, further enhancing their appeal to weight-conscious individuals seeking a practical and efficient option for weight management.

The growing preference for healthy and time-efficient meal options has driven the increasing adoption of RTD meal replacements.
