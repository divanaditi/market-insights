One of the prominent types is the directional antenna, widely used for applications requiring focused signal transmission or reception. Directional antennas are essential in sectors such as telecommunications, defense, and broadcasting, where long-range communication is critical. These antennas are designed to focus the signal in a specific direction, improving the signal strength and reliability over greater distances. Additionally, omnidirectional antennas are also prevalent, offering 360-degree coverage. These are typically employed in systems requiring wide coverage areas, such as Wi-Fi networks, automotive communications, and public safety systems. The combination of both directional and omnidirectional antennas ensures a robust and versatile network infrastructure, supporting the growing demand for connected devices and real-time monitoring in Germany's industrial landscape.<p>Another important type in the market is the patch antenna, which has gained traction in recent years due to its compact size and ease of integration. Patch antennas are commonly used in satellite communications, GPS systems, and IoT applications.
