EPS technology is increasingly gaining traction due to its energy efficiency and precision in vehicle handling. As automotive manufacturers seek to reduce vehicle weight and improve fuel efficiency, EPS is becoming a preferred choice, especially in modern vehicles. This system uses an electric motor to assist the driver, reducing the need for hydraulic fluids and pumps, which enhances both the performance and environmental sustainability of the vehicle. The shift toward electric steering systems is also driven by advancements in autonomous driving technologies, where steering systems need to be more responsive and adaptable to automated control.<p>On the other hand, hydraulic power steering (HPS) still retains a significant share of the market due to its established technology and cost-effectiveness, particularly in older vehicle models and some commercial vehicles. HPS systems operate using hydraulic fluid, which helps to assist the driver in steering, providing a more direct and traditional steering feel. Although less energy-efficient than EPS, HPS is preferred in applications requiring high torque output, such as in larger vehicles or those used in off-road conditions. While the market share of hydraulic systems is gradually declining, it remains a key player in the light vehicle steering market in Germany, particularly in regions or segments where cost considerations are more critical than energy efficiency.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/586492/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Light Vehicle Steering Systems Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Light Vehicle Steering Systems Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Light Vehicle Steering Systems Market size was valued at USD 25.4 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 35.7 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 4.7% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Light Vehicle Steering Systems Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>JTEKT</Li><Li> Bosch</Li><Li> Nexteer</Li><Li> NSK</Li><Li> ThyssenKrupp</Li><Li> ZF</Li><Li> Showa</Li><Li> Mando</Li><Li> Hyundai Mobis</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Light Vehicle Steering Systems Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Light Vehicle Steering Systems Market apart.
