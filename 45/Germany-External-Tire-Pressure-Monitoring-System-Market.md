Direct TPMS relies on sensors placed inside the tire to measure the tire's air pressure in real-time. These sensors send data to a receiver, alerting the driver to any significant loss of pressure. Direct TPMS offers high accuracy and provides real-time data, making it the preferred choice for many vehicles in Germany. This system is particularly popular in premium vehicles due to its reliability and the enhanced safety it offers. As consumer awareness of road safety grows, demand for direct TPMS is expected to rise further, especially with increasing regulatory pressure on vehicle manufacturers to enhance safety features.<p>On the other hand, indirect TPMS works by monitoring the rotation speed of each wheel. It relies on the vehicle’s ABS (anti-lock braking system) sensors to detect changes in tire pressure based on the speed variation of the tires. While indirect TPMS is less expensive than direct TPMS, it is not as precise since it indirectly measures pressure by analyzing wheel rotation. Nevertheless, it offers a more cost-effective solution for basic vehicles, which may not require the advanced features of direct TPMS. With the growing demand for affordable vehicles in Germany, indirect TPMS continues to hold a significant share in the market, providing a balance between cost and functionality.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/584046/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany External Tire Pressure Monitoring System Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany External Tire Pressure Monitoring System Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>External Tire Pressure Monitoring System Market size was valued at USD 3.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 6.5 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 8.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany External Tire Pressure Monitoring System Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Continental</Li><Li> ZF TRW</Li><Li> Lear</Li><Li> ACDelco</Li><Li> Pacific Industrial</Li><Li> Bendix</Li><Li> Huf</Li><Li> CUB Elecparts</Li><Li> Sate Auto Electronic</Li><Li> Denso</Li><Li> Baolong Automotive</Li><Li> NIRA Dynamics</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany External Tire Pressure Monitoring System Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany External Tire Pressure Monitoring System Market apart.
