One of the major types includes ceramic filters, which are well-known for their ability to withstand extreme temperatures while offering excellent filtration efficiency. These filters are typically used in industries like steel, cement, and power generation, where high thermal stability and durability are crucial. Another type gaining popularity is metallic filters, made from materials like stainless steel, which offer superior strength and longevity. These filters are widely used in sectors dealing with high-temperature gases or liquids, such as automotive and chemical processing. Both ceramic and metallic filters are favored for their robustness and ability to handle the demanding conditions of high-temperature environments, providing extended operational life and maintaining efficiency even under extreme conditions.</p><p>In addition to ceramic and metallic filters, synthetic fiber filters are also gaining traction in the German market. These filters are designed to offer high filtration performance while being lightweight and flexible, making them suitable for applications in industries such as food processing and pharmaceuticals. Synthetic fiber filters are often used in situations where a higher degree of precision is needed, such as in the filtration of fine particulates at elevated temperatures. Moreover, the increasing demand for eco-friendly filtration solutions has boosted the adoption of woven filters made from organic materials. Woven filters are favored for their ability to provide high filtration efficiency and minimal environmental impact, aligning with sustainability goals in industrial operations.
