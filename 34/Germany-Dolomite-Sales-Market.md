Calcined dolomite is produced by heating raw dolomite to a high temperature, resulting in the decomposition of calcium carbonate into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. This form of dolomite is in high demand in industries such as steel production, construction, and agriculture due to its chemical properties and ability to act as a flux in metallurgical processes. The growing demand for steel in Germany, driven by industrial development and construction activities, is a key factor driving the sales of calcined dolomite in the market. Moreover, calcined dolomite is also used in the production of refractory materials, contributing to its increasing market share in the country.</p><p>Raw dolomite, on the other hand, is used mainly in the construction and agriculture sectors. It is applied as an aggregate in the production of concrete, as well as in soil conditioning to improve pH levels in agricultural soils. The demand for raw dolomite has been influenced by the expansion of the construction industry in Germany, particularly with the increase in residential and infrastructural projects. Additionally, the use of dolomite as a soil conditioner is gaining traction due to its benefits in enhancing soil fertility and crop yields. With these applications, raw dolomite has seen steady sales growth, and the market continues to benefit from the increasing need for high-quality aggregates and agricultural inputs across various regions of Germany.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/509073/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Dolomite Sales Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Dolomite Sales Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Dolomite Sales Market size was valued at USD 3.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 5.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.2% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Dolomite Sales Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Lhoist Group</Li><Li> Imerys</Li><Li> Liuhe Mining</Li><Li> Omya Group</Li><Li> Sibelco</Li><Li> Specialty Minerals</Li><Li> RHI Magnesita</Li><Li> Nordkalk</Li><Li> Beihai Group</Li><Li> E.
