These categories represent the level of purity in the SiC powder, with 6N being the highest quality. 3N SiC powders are typically used in applications requiring a lower purity, such as in the production of devices that do not demand the highest electrical conductivity. On the other hand, 4N and 6N SiC powders are used in more demanding applications like the fabrication of high-performance semiconductor wafers, where superior purity ensures better material efficiency and enhanced device performance. The growing demand for high-power electronics, electric vehicles, and 5G technology in Germany is expected to drive the consumption of high-purity SiC powders, particularly the 4N and 6N varieties, as these materials are crucial in the production of advanced power devices and high-efficiency semiconductors.</p><p>In Germany, the market demand for high-purity SiC powders is heavily influenced by the automotive and electronics sectors, with significant growth expected in the production of energy-efficient devices. High-purity SiC powders with purity levels of 4N and 6N are essential for achieving the electrical and thermal conductivity required in the semiconductor industry, particularly for power devices used in electric vehicles and renewable energy systems. As industries shift toward greener technologies, the need for advanced materials like SiC is anticipated to increase. The rising trend of adopting electric mobility and power-efficient solutions is fueling the expansion of high-purity SiC powder usage.
