The powdered extract form holds a significant share in the market due to its ease of use, longer shelf life, and versatility across various industries. The powder can be easily incorporated into food and beverage products, cosmetics, and nutraceuticals. Its high concentration of bioactive compounds like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants makes it an attractive ingredient for functional foods and supplements, driving its demand. Additionally, powdered extracts are preferred for their lightweight packaging, making them convenient for both consumers and manufacturers.</p><p>On the other hand, liquid extracts of Himanthalia Elongata are gaining popularity due to their immediate bioavailability and ease of incorporation into liquid-based products. These extracts are used in applications where rapid absorption and quick effects are crucial, such as in liquid dietary supplements or skin care products. The liquid form is also ideal for formulations that require a smooth texture or for products where powder could compromise consistency.
