The liquid monk fruit extract holds a significant share in the market due to its versatility and ease of use in various food and beverage applications. Its liquid form offers convenience for manufacturers, making it ideal for ready-to-drink beverages, sauces, and dressings. The high solubility and sweetness intensity of the liquid form make it a popular choice among consumers seeking natural, low-calorie sweeteners. Additionally, liquid monk fruit extract is commonly used in the formulation of health supplements, energy drinks, and functional foods due to its fast-acting properties and superior sweetness profile compared to other natural sweeteners.<p>The powdered monk fruit extract is another prominent type in the market, offering advantages such as a longer shelf life and easier storage and transportation. This form is highly concentrated, providing manufacturers with a cost-effective solution for bulk production and ingredient incorporation. Powdered monk fruit extract is especially favored in the baking industry, where it can be seamlessly blended into dry mixes and baked goods without losing its sweetness potency. Additionally, powdered extracts are widely used in dietary supplements, where precise dosing is required. The demand for powdered monk fruit extract is growing as more consumers seek products with a clean label, minimal processing, and natural ingredients.
