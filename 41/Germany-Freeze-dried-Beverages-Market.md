The variety of tea types, such as green tea, herbal tea, and fruit infusions, caters to diverse consumer preferences. The segment has benefited from increasing awareness of the health benefits of tea, which has led to a shift in consumer behavior towards healthier alternatives. Additionally, the rising popularity of plant-based and natural products is encouraging tea brands to introduce innovative freeze-dried options that provide superior taste and quality.
