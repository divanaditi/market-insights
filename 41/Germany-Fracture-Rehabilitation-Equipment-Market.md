Functional electrical stimulation (FES) devices are used to stimulate muscles in patients recovering from fractures, helping to improve muscle strength and coordination. These devices aid in muscle re-education and rehabilitation by delivering low-frequency electrical impulses. Therapeutic ultrasound devices use sound waves to accelerate healing by promoting tissue regeneration, reducing swelling, and enhancing circulation in injured areas. Continuous passive motion (CPM) devices are primarily used for joint rehabilitation by providing controlled movement to the injured area, preventing stiffness, and promoting mobility, especially after bone fractures. These equipment types are widely used in both hospital settings and outpatient clinics, offering significant benefits in post-fracture recovery and rehabilitation processes.</p><p>Another important category in the market includes mechanical traction devices and orthopedic braces. Mechanical traction devices are used to apply a pulling force on the affected bone, helping to realign fractures and reduce muscle spasms, contributing to faster healing. Orthopedic braces, on the other hand, are designed to provide support and stabilization to fractured bones, minimizing movement and promoting proper alignment during the healing process. These devices are commonly used for fractures of the limbs, providing both comfort and protection. With technological advancements, modern orthopedic braces are lightweight, adjustable, and designed to improve patient mobility while maintaining fracture immobilization. The demand for these rehabilitation devices is driven by an increasing aging population, rising awareness about fracture rehabilitation, and advancements in medical technologies that enhance the overall recovery experience for patients.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/555588/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Fracture Rehabilitation Equipment Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Fracture Rehabilitation Equipment Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Fracture Rehabilitation Equipment Market size was valued at USD 1.55 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.30 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.3% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Fracture Rehabilitation Equipment Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Adler Ortho SpA</Li><Li> Altimed Ltd</Li><Li> BioPro Implants</Li><Li> Johnson & Johnson</Li><Li> OrthoFi</Li><Li> Paragon 28</Li><Li> Sanhe MDC Medical Devices Co</Li><Li> Stryker Corporation</Li><Li> Wright Medical Group NV</Li><Li> Zimmer Biomet Holdings</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Fracture Rehabilitation Equipment Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Fracture Rehabilitation Equipment Market apart.
