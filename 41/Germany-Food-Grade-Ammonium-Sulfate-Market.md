The crystalline segment holds a significant share of the market due to its high purity and uniformity, which makes it ideal for use in food applications. Crystalline ammonium sulfate is commonly utilized in the production of food additives, including flavor enhancers, preservatives, and fortification agents. This form is preferred in industries requiring precise formulation and consistency in product quality. Additionally, crystalline ammonium sulfate is highly soluble, making it suitable for both dry and liquid applications in food manufacturing.</p><p>The granular form of ammonium sulfate is another prominent type in the food-grade segment. It is primarily used for bulk applications where easy handling, storage, and transport are necessary. Granular ammonium sulfate is favored in agricultural and food production processes where larger quantities are required. It is typically used in processing meats and dairy products, providing essential nutrients and enhancing the quality of finished products. The granular type's versatility and stability contribute to its growing adoption in the food industry, driven by increasing demand for high-quality food ingredients.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/560384/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Food Grade Ammonium Sulfate Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Food Grade Ammonium Sulfate Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Food Grade Ammonium Sulfate Market size was valued at USD 1.45 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.0 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 4.0% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Food Grade Ammonium Sulfate Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Food Evonik Industries</Li><Li> Lanxess</Li><Li> Novus International</Li><Li> DOMO Chemicals</Li><Li> BASF SE</Li><Li> Honeywell</Li><Li> SABIC</Li><Li> ArcelorMittal</Li><Li> Brenntag</Li><Li> Nanjing Jiayi Sunway Chemical Co.
