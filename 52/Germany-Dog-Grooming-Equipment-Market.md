Brushes and combs are essential tools in pet grooming, helping to maintain the coat's cleanliness and health. These products come in different designs, such as slicker brushes and de-shedding combs, to cater to various dog breeds and hair types. Clippers and trimmers are highly popular for their efficiency in cutting and trimming dog fur, especially for professional groomers. These tools are designed to offer smooth and precise cuts, making them an indispensable part of dog grooming routines. The rising demand for convenience and precision in pet grooming is driving the adoption of these products across households and grooming salons in Germany.</p><p>Shampoos and conditioners represent a significant segment of the dog grooming market, with an increasing focus on specialized formulations for different dog skin types. These products are tailored to enhance coat texture and provide soothing treatments for skin irritations.
