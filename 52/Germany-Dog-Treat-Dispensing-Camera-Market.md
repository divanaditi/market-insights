This type of camera typically connects to a smartphone or tablet app, enabling users to watch their dogs in real-time and dispense treats at the push of a button. Basic models are popular among pet owners looking for affordable solutions for occasional interaction and remote monitoring. They offer basic functionalities at a relatively lower price point, making them accessible for a larger consumer base. The second major type in this market includes advanced smart cameras with enhanced features. These models come with higher resolution video, improved treat dispensing mechanisms, and additional functionalities such as two-way audio, motion detection, and even integration with home automation systems.
