These materials combine the characteristics of rubber and thermoplastics, offering high durability, flexibility, and recyclability. TPEs are widely used in automotive components such as interior parts, weather seals, and cable insulation, as they provide enhanced performance while contributing to cost savings. The increasing need for lightweight, fuel-efficient vehicles and improved sustainability is driving the adoption of TPE in the automotive sector. Additionally, advancements in TPE formulations are expanding their application scope, making them suitable for more complex automotive parts.On the other hand, thermoset elastomers, such as epichlorohydrin rubber (ECO) and nitrile rubber (NBR), remain essential for high-performance applications. These materials exhibit excellent heat resistance, superior chemical stability, and excellent sealing capabilities, making them ideal for engine components, gaskets, and seals. The automotive industry’s shift towards more stringent regulations regarding fuel efficiency and emissions is spurring the demand for thermoset elastomers, particularly for applications that require high resilience to extreme operating conditions. The combination of performance benefits and regulatory requirements continues to boost the popularity of thermosets in the German automotive market.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/645344/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Automotive Elastomer Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Automotive Elastomer Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Automotive Elastomer Market size was valued at USD 17.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 28.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.1% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Automotive Elastomer Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Arlanxeo</Li><Li> DOW</Li><Li> Exxonmobil</Li><Li> JSR Corporation</Li><Li> Dupont</Li><Li> BASF</Li><Li> LG Chem</Li><Li> Sabic</Li><Li> Teknor Apex</Li><Li> Zeon Corporation</Li><Li> Nizhnekamskneftekhim Pjsc</Li><Li> Versalis</Li><Li> Covestro</Li><Li> Mitsubishi Chemicals</Li><Li> Kraiburg TEP GmbH & Co.
