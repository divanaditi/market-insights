The metallic foils are available in gold, silver, and other metallic hues, offering superior aesthetics and high-end appeal. This type of foil is also gaining popularity in the automotive and electronics industries, where branding and visual appeal are key considerations.</p><p>Another prominent segment in the market is the pigmented foils, which are widely used in the printing industry for producing colored designs. Pigmented hot stamping foils offer a diverse range of colors and are used for producing matte, satin, or glossy effects. These foils are commonly employed in applications such as decorative printing, packaging, and branding, where vibrant colors and unique finishes are required.
