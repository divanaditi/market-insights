The food-grade segment holds a significant share in the market, driven by the growing demand for food additives and emulsifiers in the food and beverage industry. Glycerin monostearate (GMS) is widely used in the production of bakery goods, dairy products, and beverages to improve texture, extend shelf life, and enhance product stability. The increasing consumption of processed and convenience foods in Germany has fueled the demand for food-grade GMS. Additionally, strict regulations and quality standards governing food additives have further contributed to the preference for food-grade glycerin monostearate in the region.<p>The industrial-grade segment is also witnessing steady growth in the Germany distilled glycerin monostearate market.
