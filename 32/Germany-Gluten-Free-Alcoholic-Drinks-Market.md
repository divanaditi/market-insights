Beer, as a major category in this market, holds a significant share. Gluten-free beer, brewed without wheat or barley, is gaining popularity among consumers who are gluten-intolerant or prefer gluten-free options. These beers are often made from alternative grains such as sorghum, rice, or millet, providing a similar taste to traditional beer while catering to dietary restrictions. The growing acceptance and availability of gluten-free beer in bars, restaurants, and retail outlets is further fueling the market's expansion. Additionally, many established beer manufacturers are introducing gluten-free variants to meet this emerging demand and appeal to health-conscious consumers in Germany. The expansion of craft breweries also contributes to the increasing availability of gluten-free beer options, providing greater variety and choice to consumers.</p><p>Wine and spirits also represent key segments in the gluten-free alcoholic drinks market in Germany.
