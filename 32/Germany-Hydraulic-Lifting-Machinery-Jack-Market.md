Bottle jacks are widely used due to their compact size and high lifting capacity, making them ideal for both personal and professional use. These jacks are typically used in automotive repair, construction, and industrial applications. Their ease of use and portability make them suitable for smaller lifting tasks, particularly in confined spaces. On the other hand, floor jacks are preferred for heavier lifting tasks, offering greater stability and larger lifting capacities. They are commonly employed in garages, workshops, and other industrial settings where lifting heavy machinery and vehicles is required. The floor jack's wide base and the ability to handle higher loads have made it a critical tool in the lifting machinery market.<p>The market for hydraulic lifting machinery jacks in Germany also includes scissor jacks, which are specifically designed for lifting heavy loads vertically. These jacks are frequently used in vehicle maintenance, especially for raising cars and trucks for tire changes or repairs. Scissor jacks are known for their reliability and are an essential tool for professionals in the automotive industry. Another important segment in the market is the trolley jacks, which are widely used in automotive workshops for their ability to lift large vehicles effortlessly.
