The key segments include turbines, generators, and auxiliary equipment. Turbines are essential for converting the kinetic energy of flowing water into mechanical energy, with Kaplan, Pelton, and Francis turbines being the most commonly used types in hydroelectric plants. These turbines vary in design and performance based on the water flow conditions and the head height of the location. Generators, on the other hand, are used to convert mechanical energy from the turbines into electrical energy. These generators are crucial for producing the electricity that is distributed to the grid. Auxiliary equipment encompasses the entire support system required for the efficient operation of hydroelectric plants, including transformers, switchgear, and control systems, which ensure stable power transmission and monitoring capabilities in the system.</p><p>Another important segment in the market is the control and monitoring equipment, which plays a vital role in optimizing the operation of hydroelectric plants. These systems manage the performance and safety of turbines, generators, and other machinery, ensuring they operate within their specified parameters. The increasing demand for automation in hydroelectric power stations is driving the growth of this segment. Additionally, the maintenance and repair services for these electromechanical devices are gaining importance, as aging infrastructure in older hydroelectric plants requires frequent upgrades. These services are integral to ensuring continued operational efficiency and energy output.
