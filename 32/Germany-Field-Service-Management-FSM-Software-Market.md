Cloud-based solutions dominate the market due to their flexibility, cost-efficiency, and ease of scalability. These software systems enable businesses to access their FSM platforms from anywhere, making them ideal for industries requiring real-time updates and remote operations. Cloud solutions offer automatic updates, enhanced security, and minimal infrastructure costs, which contribute to their widespread adoption across small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as well as large organizations. Additionally, the shift towards digital transformation across industries has fueled the preference for cloud-based solutions, with a growing demand for integrated tools to manage service delivery, logistics, and customer relationships more effectively.<p>On the other hand, on-premises FSM software is still relevant, particularly for organizations with stringent data security requirements or those operating in regulated industries. This type of software is installed locally on a company's servers, offering businesses more control over their data and customization options. While it tends to have higher initial setup costs, on-premises FSM software is preferred by larger enterprises or those with established IT infrastructures.
