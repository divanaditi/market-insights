Native starches, which are derived directly from plants such as corn, wheat, and potatoes, are commonly used in food and non-food applications due to their natural properties. These starches are primarily utilized in the food industry for thickening, stabilizing, and gelling purposes. Modified starches, on the other hand, are chemically or physically altered to improve their functionality in specific industrial applications. They are increasingly used in processed food products, paper, textiles, and pharmaceuticals, offering enhanced performance characteristics such as better solubility, resistance to heat, and improved texture. The demand for modified starches in Germany has grown due to their versatility in industrial applications.</p><p>Starch derivatives form another key segment within the industrial starches market in Germany. These derivatives, such as glucose, maltodextrin, and starch esters, are produced by further processing native or modified starches to create specialized products. Glucose and maltodextrin are widely used as sweeteners, thickeners, and stabilizers in the food and beverage industries, contributing to the growth of the starch derivatives segment. Starch esters are utilized in various applications, including cosmetics, detergents, and biodegradable plastics.
