HV submarine cables typically operate at voltages ranging from 30 kV to 245 kV and are used for various offshore wind power generation and interconnection projects. These cables are primarily utilized for shorter distances and in applications that do not require extensive transmission capabilities. As the demand for renewable energy solutions rises, HV cables are gaining traction for efficient energy transportation over moderate distances, such as interconnecting offshore wind farms to mainland grids. Their development is also influenced by the increasing need for high-efficiency energy transmission across challenging marine environments. This segment continues to witness innovations in materials and manufacturing to enhance the reliability and lifespan of the cables in harsh underwater conditions.</p><p>On the other hand, Extra High Voltage (EHV) submarine power cables are designed for high-capacity energy transmission, typically ranging from 245 kV and above. These cables are integral to long-distance underwater energy transmission projects, especially for cross-border interconnections and large-scale offshore wind farms. EHV cables are capable of handling the substantial energy flow required for large industrial applications, where efficiency and reliability are paramount.
