Food products, which include dry food, wet food, and treats, form the largest segment, driven by pet owners’ preference for nutritious and specialized diets for their pets. The demand for premium, organic, and specialized pet foods, such as grain-free and allergy-friendly options, is also on the rise. Along with traditional pet food, there is an increasing market for functional food products, such as supplements aimed at promoting pets’ health. This trend is largely driven by the growing awareness among pet owners about pet nutrition and the importance of a balanced diet for pets.</p><p>The non-food segment includes a wide range of products, such as grooming items, bedding, toys, and accessories. Grooming supplies like shampoos, brushes, and nail clippers have seen considerable growth, as pet owners increasingly prioritize the well-being of their pets. Additionally, pet toys and accessories, including collars, leashes, and pet carriers, are also growing in popularity. These products are highly influenced by trends in pet care and the growing demand for premium, innovative, and environmentally-friendly options. With the increasing number of pet adoptions, the non-food segment is expanding rapidly, making it a key driver in the German pet supplies market.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/500206/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Household Pet Supplies Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Household Pet Supplies Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Household Pet Supplies Market size was valued at USD 123.45 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 180.00 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.2% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Household Pet Supplies Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Spectrum Brands</Li><Li> Hartz</Li><Li> Central Garden & Pet Company</Li><Li> Jarden Consumer Solutions</Li><Li> Wahl Clipper Corporation</Li><Li> Andis Company</Li><Li> Geib Buttercut</Li><Li> Rolf C.
