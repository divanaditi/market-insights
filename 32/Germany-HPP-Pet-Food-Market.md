The first major category is wet pet food, which includes meals that are often packaged in pouches, cans, or trays. This type of food is highly popular due to its convenience and palatability for pets, especially dogs and cats. Wet pet food typically contains higher moisture content, making it more appealing and hydrating for pets. As HPP technology helps preserve the nutritional value and extend shelf life without the need for artificial preservatives, this segment continues to experience growth in Germany, where consumers are increasingly seeking natural and safe food options for their pets. The demand for wet pet food has surged, driven by growing awareness about pet health and an increasing preference for premium food options that use HPP for better food safety and quality retention.</p><p>Another significant segment in the Germany HPP pet food market is dry pet food, which includes kibble and biscuits. Dry pet food remains a popular choice for pet owners due to its long shelf life, ease of storage, and affordability. With the application of HPP technology, dry pet food products benefit from improved safety and freshness, while maintaining the necessary nutritional levels. As more consumers are gravitating towards healthier and more organic pet food options, HPP is becoming a key differentiator in the dry food segment. Manufacturers in Germany are focusing on producing dry pet foods with high-quality ingredients, using HPP to preserve the food without the need for additives or preservatives.
