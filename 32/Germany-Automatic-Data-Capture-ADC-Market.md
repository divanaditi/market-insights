Barcode technology remains the most widely used ADC type, owing to its cost-effectiveness and ease of implementation. It is commonly utilized in various industries such as retail, logistics, and manufacturing for tracking products and inventory. Barcode systems capture data through scanners that read printed barcodes, making them a popular choice for businesses looking for reliable and affordable solutions. OCR technology, on the other hand, enables automatic data capture by recognizing and interpreting printed or handwritten characters. It is widely used in sectors such as document management, banking, and healthcare for applications like invoice processing and form scanning.</p><p>RFID technology, another prominent type of ADC, allows for contactless data capture through the use of radio waves. It is particularly effective for asset tracking and supply chain management, providing real-time visibility and reducing manual errors. RFID tags, when attached to objects, can be read from a distance, offering greater efficiency compared to other methods. In addition, the market also includes other emerging ADC technologies such as voice recognition and biometric systems.
