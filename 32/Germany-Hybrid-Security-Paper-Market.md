One of the primary types in the market is the paper embedded with security fibers. These fibers are woven into the paper during the manufacturing process and are highly visible, offering easy verification of authenticity. The inclusion of multi-colored and multi-directional security threads increases the level of protection against counterfeiting. This type is widely used in banknotes, government documents, and high-value certificates. Additionally, watermarks are another essential feature of hybrid security paper, offering an additional layer of security. Watermarks are embedded during production and are visible when the paper is held against light, which makes it extremely difficult to reproduce. They are commonly used in passports, legal documents, and currency notes to prevent unauthorized copying and forgery.</p><p>Another prominent type of hybrid security paper is the one that integrates both optical and microtext features. This category includes papers with optically variable inks or holographic images that shift in color when viewed from different angles. These dynamic features create a highly effective barrier against counterfeiting. Microtext, which involves printing text that is only visible under magnification, is also used in conjunction with optical inks. This combination enhances the paper’s security level, making it difficult for counterfeiters to replicate.
