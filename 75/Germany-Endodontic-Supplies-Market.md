As dental technology advances, there is a growing demand for more precise, user-friendly, and ergonomic instruments, leading to innovations in the design and functionality of endodontic tools. The increase in endodontic procedures across Germany contributes to the growth of the instruments segment, driven by the adoption of new technologies that ensure better clinical outcomes and reduce patient discomfort.<p>On the other hand, consumables in the German endodontic market include materials such as root canal sealers, gutta-percha points, and irrigants, which are integral to the root canal treatment process. These consumables help in disinfecting the canals, filling them after cleaning, and sealing them to prevent reinfection. Gutta-percha, a biocompatible material, remains a staple for filling the root canal space due to its ease of use and long-term stability. The growing focus on patient safety and treatment efficiency is propelling the demand for high-quality consumables.
