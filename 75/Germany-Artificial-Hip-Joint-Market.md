Cemented hip joints, which are fixed using a special bone cement, are widely used due to their ease of implantation and reliability, particularly in older patients with low bone density. This type of hip joint is often preferred for patients who require immediate stability. Cemented joints are also known for their durability, making them a popular choice in clinical practice. These features contribute to the sustained demand for cemented hip joints in Germany, especially in the aging population where joint replacement surgeries are becoming increasingly common.</p><p>Cementless hip joints, on the other hand, are designed to allow the bone to grow into the surface of the implant, fostering long-term stability without the need for cement. These implants are typically used in younger patients with better bone quality, as they offer the potential for longer-lasting results. The cementless hip joint segment has been witnessing growth in the Germany market due to advancements in materials, which enhance the implant’s durability and integration with the bone. Surgeons are increasingly opting for cementless implants in patients with healthy bone structure, further contributing to the expanding share of this segment in the market.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/826398/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Artificial Hip Joint Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Artificial Hip Joint Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Artificial Hip Joint Market size was valued at USD 4.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 7.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Artificial Hip Joint Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Zimmer Biomet Holdings</Li><Li> Johnson & Johnson</Li><Li> Stryker Corporation</Li><Li> Smith & Nephew</Li><Li> MicroPort Scientific Corporation</Li><Li> Exactech</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> DJO Global</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> B.
