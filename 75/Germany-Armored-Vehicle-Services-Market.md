The maintenance services segment includes routine inspections, preventive maintenance, and upgrades designed to ensure optimal performance and longevity of armored vehicles. Maintenance services are critical for law enforcement agencies, military units, and private security organizations, ensuring that their fleet remains operational and fully functional. The growing demand for continuous service contracts and long-term maintenance agreements is driving the expansion of this market. As security concerns rise, especially in high-risk areas, the need for robust and reliable armored vehicles with regular upkeep becomes increasingly significant in both the defense and commercial sectors.</p><p>The repair services segment focuses on fixing damage caused by external factors such as hostile environments, accidents, or wear and tear. This includes specialized services like ballistic repair, chassis reinforcements, and electronic system repairs. Armored vehicle repair requires highly skilled technicians and access to advanced technologies to ensure the vehicle can withstand future threats. As military operations and high-security operations become more frequent, the demand for rapid, efficient repair services grows.
