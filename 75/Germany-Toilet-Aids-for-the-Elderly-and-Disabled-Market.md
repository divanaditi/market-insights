These chairs can be placed over a standard toilet or used independently in different locations. Additionally, the market includes support bars and grab rails, which help individuals maintain balance and stability while using the toilet. These aids are essential in preventing accidents and promoting independent toileting for elderly and disabled individuals who may have difficulty with mobility or strength.</p><p>Other important products in this market include toilet paper aids, which assist users with limited reach or hand dexterity. These devices are designed to help individuals maintain hygiene independently, offering greater comfort and dignity. Bidets and bidet toilet seats are also becoming more popular in Germany, providing gentle cleaning solutions that are particularly helpful for people with arthritis or those who struggle with manual wiping. These bidet systems often feature adjustable water temperature, pressure, and position controls for ease of use. Lastly, transfer boards and slide sheets are available for those requiring assistance in moving from a wheelchair to the toilet. These aids facilitate smoother, safer transitions, reducing the risk of injury during transfers.
