The most popular categories include knee supports, ankle supports, back supports, wrist supports, and elbow supports. Knee braces are particularly in demand, as they are used for both rehabilitation and injury prevention, especially among athletes and older adults. Ankle supports are also commonly used, as they help stabilize the joint after sprains or strains. The growing prevalence of sports injuries and musculoskeletal disorders contributes to the increasing demand for these supports across various demographics. Additionally, back supports are widely used for both therapeutic and ergonomic purposes, especially in individuals with chronic back pain or those in physically demanding occupations. <p>Wrist supports are gaining popularity due to the rising number of repetitive stress injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, which affect many workers in office and manual labor settings. Elbow supports, though less common, are vital for individuals who experience joint discomfort from activities like weightlifting or repetitive overhead movements. Soft braces, made of elastic materials, and hard braces, which are typically made from more rigid components, are the two major types available in the market. These products cater to different severity levels of injuries or conditions, offering varying degrees of support and mobility. The shift toward non-invasive, convenient, and easily accessible products is driving the growth of OTC braces and supports in Germany, as more individuals seek solutions that do not require a prescription or professional intervention.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/827332/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany OTC Braces and Supports Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany OTC Braces and Supports Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>OTC Braces and Supports Market size was valued at USD 6.2 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 10.1 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.7% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany OTC Braces and Supports Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>DJO Finance LLC</Li><Li> Ossur Hf</Li><Li> Breg</Li><Li> Inc</Li><Li> Bauerfeind AG</Li><Li> Ottobock Holding GmbH and Co.
