Metal-on-metal discs are known for their durability and strength, offering enhanced wear resistance. These devices are typically made from high-quality titanium or cobalt-chromium alloys, providing a robust solution for patients with degenerative disc disease or other spinal disorders. The MoM artificial discs are increasingly popular due to their long-term performance and minimal risk of wear debris, making them suitable for younger and more active patients. As the preference for advanced materials continues to grow, metal-on-metal implants are expected to maintain a significant market share in Germany's lumbar artificial disc sector.<p>On the other hand, metal-on-polymer artificial discs are designed to combine the mechanical strength of metal with the cushioning properties of polymer materials. These discs are often favored for their enhanced biomechanical properties, offering better flexibility and shock absorption. The metal-on-polymer type is particularly advantageous for patients with moderate disc degeneration or those looking for a more cost-effective solution. The growing trend of minimally invasive surgeries in Germany has driven the demand for metal-on-polymer discs, which are easier to implant and offer quicker recovery times. Both types are continuously evolving, with ongoing research and development aimed at improving performance, longevity, and patient outcomes.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/828884/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Lumbar Artificial Disc Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Lumbar Artificial Disc Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Lumbar Artificial Disc Market size was valued at USD 1.2 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.3 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 8.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Lumbar Artificial Disc Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>AxioMed</Li><Li> Simplify Medical</Li><Li> K2M</Li><Li> Spinal Kinetics</Li><Li> Globus Medical</Li><Li> Johnson & Johnson</Li><Li> B.
