External beam radiation therapy is the most common method of radiation treatment and involves directing high-energy rays from outside the body to the tumor. This technique is typically used for treating solid tumors and is available in several advanced forms such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT). These methods provide precise tumor targeting, minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues. The increasing adoption of sophisticated radiation technologies in hospitals and treatment centers is boosting the growth of this segment in Germany.<p>Brachytherapy, or internal radiation therapy, is another significant segment in the German market, where radioactive sources are placed directly inside or near the tumor. It is commonly used for treating cancers of the prostate, cervix, and breast, among others. Brachytherapy offers the advantage of delivering a high dose of radiation to the tumor while reducing exposure to adjacent healthy tissues. The growing preference for minimally invasive treatments and the development of more efficient, safe, and targeted brachytherapy techniques have contributed to its rising demand. Germany's strong healthcare infrastructure and technological advancements in this area are likely to support continued market growth in the coming years.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/823048/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Radiation Therapy Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Radiation Therapy Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Radiation Therapy Market size was valued at USD 6.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 11.9 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 8.0% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Radiation Therapy Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Varian Medical</Li><Li> Elekta</Li><Li> Accuray</Li><Li> Ion Beam</Li><Li> Nordion</Li><Li> C.
