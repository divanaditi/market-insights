This segment has seen growing demand, particularly among individuals seeking personalized health information without the need to visit a clinic or laboratory. The increasing awareness of genetic testing and advancements in biotechnology further fuel the market's expansion in Germany. DNA testing kits are also being used for paternity tests, ancestry research, and understanding genetic risks, contributing to their growing popularity in the country.<p>On the other hand, disease detection kits are gaining momentum in the German market due to their convenience and ability to identify various health conditions at home. These kits allow individuals to test for infections, such as COVID-19, or monitor chronic conditions like diabetes, all from the comfort of their own homes. As the demand for non-invasive and private health monitoring solutions rises, the disease detection segment is expected to grow. These kits typically offer fast, accurate results, making them an attractive option for consumers who prefer self-testing.
