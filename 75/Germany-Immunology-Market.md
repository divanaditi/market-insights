Diagnostic immunology primarily focuses on the detection and diagnosis of immune-related disorders, such as autoimmune diseases, allergies, and infections. It includes a range of laboratory tests, including immunoassays and molecular diagnostics, which help in the identification of specific markers or pathogens. These diagnostic tools are increasingly crucial in clinical settings for accurate and timely disease identification, enabling personalized treatment strategies. The growing prevalence of immune system-related diseases in Germany is contributing to the rising demand for advanced diagnostic techniques, further driving market expansion in this segment.</p><p>On the other hand, therapeutic immunology involves the development and use of immunotherapy treatments aimed at enhancing or modulating the immune system's response. This includes biologics such as monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and immune checkpoint inhibitors, which are increasingly being used to treat various conditions like cancer, autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory disorders. The therapeutic immunology market in Germany has seen significant growth due to innovations in immune-oncology treatments and the high adoption of immunotherapy drugs in clinical practice. The rise in chronic diseases, coupled with technological advancements in immunotherapy, is expected to sustain market growth in the coming years.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/823144/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Immunology Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Immunology Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Immunology Market size was valued at USD 85 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 121 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.0% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Immunology Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>AbbVie</Li><Li> Amgen</Li><Li> F.
