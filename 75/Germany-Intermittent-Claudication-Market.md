Drug-based therapies include antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, and vasodilators, which are primarily used to manage the symptoms of intermittent claudication by improving blood flow and reducing pain during walking. The growing prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in Germany has increased the demand for pharmaceutical treatments that alleviate the discomfort and mobility restrictions associated with intermittent claudication. Medications are often prescribed as a first-line treatment to prevent the progression of PAD and to improve patient quality of life. This segment is expected to experience steady growth due to the continuous advancements in drug formulations and the increasing adoption of these therapies in clinical settings across Germany.</p><p>On the other hand, non-drug-based therapies encompass lifestyle interventions, exercise programs, and surgical options such as revascularization procedures. These treatments are commonly recommended when medications alone are insufficient to manage symptoms or when there is a need to address underlying vascular issues. Exercise programs, such as supervised walking regimens, have gained popularity in the management of intermittent claudication due to their proven effectiveness in improving leg muscle strength and increasing walking distance. Surgical interventions, including angioplasty or bypass surgery, are considered for more severe cases. This segment's growth is driven by the rising awareness of the benefits of non-invasive therapies and the increasing availability of advanced surgical options to treat intermittent claudication in Germany.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/829128/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Intermittent Claudication Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Intermittent Claudication Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Intermittent Claudication Market size was valued at USD 1.25 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.02 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Intermittent Claudication Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>I'ROM GROUP(DNAVEC Corporation)</Li><Li> Nuo Therapeutics Inc</Li><Li> Kowa Company Ltd.</Li><Li> LTT Bio-Pharma</Li><Li> Pluristem Therapeutics Inc</Li><Li> Nuo Therapeutics</Li><Li> Inc(Aldagen</Li><Li> Inc)</Li><Li> Genovate Biotechnology Co.</Li><Li> Ltd.</Li><Li> Novartis AG</Li><Li> ID Pharma Co.</Li><Li> Ltd</Li><Li> Helixmith Co.</Li><Li> Ltd.</Li><Li> G.
