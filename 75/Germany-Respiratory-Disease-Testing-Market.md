Molecular tests include PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), which are widely used for detecting respiratory infections caused by viruses such as COVID-19, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). These tests are known for their high sensitivity and accuracy, making them a preferred choice for diagnosing respiratory diseases. The rise in the prevalence of viral infections, combined with advancements in molecular diagnostics, has increased the demand for these testing methods. PCR-based tests, in particular, have been instrumental in identifying viral strains and providing timely results, which has driven their adoption in hospitals, clinics, and laboratories across Germany.</p><p>On the other hand, immunoassays are another key segment in the respiratory disease testing market, offering a rapid and cost-effective solution for detecting antigens and antibodies related to respiratory infections. Immunoassay methods, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and lateral flow assays, are popular due to their ability to deliver quick results, often within minutes. These tests are frequently used for point-of-care testing and large-scale screenings, providing an efficient means for diagnosing respiratory diseases like influenza and COVID-19. Their widespread use in healthcare settings, combined with the growing demand for rapid testing solutions, has contributed to the expansion of the immunoassay segment within the German market.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/824668/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Respiratory Disease Testing Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Respiratory Disease Testing Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Respiratory Disease Testing Market size was valued at USD 3.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 5.8 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.2% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Respiratory Disease Testing Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Fischer & Paykel</Li><Li> Medtronic</Li><Li> MGC Diagnostics Corporation</Li><Li> CAREstream Medical Ltd.</Li><Li> Becton Dickinson (Carefusion Corporation)</Li><Li> Koninklijke Philips N.V.
