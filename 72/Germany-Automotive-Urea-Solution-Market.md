The standard urea solution, also known as AdBlue, is a widely used product for diesel vehicles equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems. This solution helps reduce nitrogen oxide emissions, a significant pollutant in diesel engines. The widespread adoption of this type is driven by stringent emission regulations across the European Union, which necessitate the use of SCR technology to meet Euro 6 standards. With its proven efficiency and cost-effectiveness, standard urea solutions hold a dominant market share in Germany and are extensively used in passenger cars, trucks, and other commercial vehicles. Manufacturers are constantly working to improve the performance and reliability of these solutions to meet the growing demand for sustainable automotive solutions in the region.</p><p>Enhanced urea solutions, on the other hand, are formulated with higher concentrations of urea and other additives that improve the overall efficiency of the SCR system. These solutions offer better resistance to freezing in colder climates, which is crucial in Germany’s harsh winter conditions. As a result, enhanced urea solutions have seen increasing adoption in regions with extreme weather, as they provide superior performance and ensure the proper functioning of the SCR systems.
