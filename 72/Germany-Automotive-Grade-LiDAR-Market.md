Mechanical LiDAR systems use rotating components to scan the environment, providing a 360-degree view. These systems are known for their high accuracy, range, and resolution, making them highly suitable for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. The mechanical LiDAR technology has been dominant due to its established performance and reliability in complex driving scenarios. However, its moving parts can be vulnerable to wear and tear, which could limit its adoption in the long term. Despite this, mechanical LiDAR remains a key player in the German market as automakers continue to rely on its precise sensing capabilities for safety and navigation applications.<p>On the other hand, Solid-State LiDAR is rapidly gaining traction in the automotive industry due to its compact size, robustness, and lack of moving parts. This technology offers significant advantages in terms of durability, cost-effectiveness, and integration into vehicles. Solid-state LiDAR systems utilize photonic or optical technologies, such as micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) or flash LiDAR, to capture detailed 3D images of the vehicle's surroundings. These sensors are not only smaller and lighter than mechanical counterparts, but they also provide reliable performance in diverse weather conditions, which is essential for the German automotive market.
