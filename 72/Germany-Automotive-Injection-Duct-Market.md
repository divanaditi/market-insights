Plastic injection ducts dominate the market due to their lightweight properties, cost-effectiveness, and ability to be easily molded into complex shapes. These ducts are widely used in engine applications for air and exhaust systems, offering durability and flexibility. The demand for plastic injection ducts is primarily driven by the increasing focus on fuel efficiency and emission reduction in automotive design. As the automotive industry in Germany continues to push towards lighter, more energy-efficient vehicles, the preference for plastic ducts is expected to grow further, reinforcing their market share in the coming years.</p><p>On the other hand, metal injection ducts, although a smaller segment, are gaining traction in applications requiring higher strength and heat resistance. These ducts are particularly suitable for performance vehicles, where robust construction is critical. They offer superior durability, heat resistance, and can withstand high-pressure conditions typically found in high-performance engine environments. The use of metal injection ducts is expected to see gradual growth as manufacturers aim to enhance vehicle performance, particularly in luxury and sports car segments. As technological advancements in metallurgy and injection molding continue, the versatility and appeal of metal injection ducts in the automotive sector may ultimately</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/805258/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Automotive Injection Duct Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Automotive Injection Duct Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Automotive Injection Duct Market size was valued at USD 2.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 4.1 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.1% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Automotive Injection Duct Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>NORMA Group</Li><Li> Visteon Corporation</Li><Li> MAHLE GmbH</Li><Li> Calsonic Kansei Corporation</Li><Li> Hutchinson SA</Li><Li> Cooper Standard</Li><Li> Sumitomo Riko Company Limited</Li><Li> Toyoda Gosei Co.</Li><Li> Ltd</Li><Li> Behr Hella Service GmbH</Li><Li> Magna International Inc.</Li><Li> Brose Fahrzeugteile GmbH & Co.
