Conventional EPS systems are widely used in most modern vehicles, providing better fuel efficiency, improved handling, and a reduction in steering effort. These systems are powered by an electric motor instead of a hydraulic pump, contributing to the overall lightweight and energy-efficient design of the vehicle. The growing demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid vehicles in Germany has significantly accelerated the adoption of EPS systems due to their compatibility with energy-efficient technologies and low maintenance costs. EPS systems also offer adjustable steering responses, enhancing driving comfort and vehicle safety, which further strengthens their position in the market.<p>On the other hand, the advanced steer-by-wire systems represent a more cutting-edge technology gaining traction in the German automotive sector. This system completely eliminates the mechanical and hydraulic linkages between the steering wheel and the wheels, using electronic signals to control the steering. Steer-by-wire technology allows for greater design flexibility, as the absence of a physical connection between the wheel and the steering mechanism enables automakers to optimize the cabin space and interior layout. As autonomous and electric vehicles become more popular in Germany, steer-by-wire systems are increasingly seen as essential for enhancing vehicle performance, reducing weight, and enabling more precise control over the driving experience. The adoption of these advanced systems is expected to rise significantly, as they offer a higher degree of customization and integrate well with automated driving technologies.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/805106/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Automotive Intelligent Steering System Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Automotive Intelligent Steering System Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Automotive Intelligent Steering System Market size was valued at USD 6.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 12.3 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 8.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Automotive Intelligent Steering System Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Robert Bosch GmbH</Li><Li> ZF Friedrichshafen AG</Li><Li> IMS Ltd.</Li><Li> Denso Corporation</Li><Li> Knorr-Bremse AG</Li><Li> Smart Wheel</Li><Li> Jaguar Land Rover</Li><Li> JTEKT Corporation</Li><Li> Mando Corporation</Li><Li> NSK Ltd.</Li><Li> Showa Corporation</Li><Li> Nexteer Automotive</Li><Li> ThyssenKrupp AG</Li><Li> Hitachi Automotive</Li><Li> Mitsubishi</Li><Li> Hyundai Mobis Co.
