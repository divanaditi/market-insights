Rubber-based torsional vibration dampers are widely used in the automotive industry due to their flexibility and ability to absorb a broad range of vibrations. These dampers are particularly effective in reducing engine vibrations, ensuring smoother vehicle performance, and enhancing overall driving comfort. The high demand for fuel-efficient and noise-reduced vehicles has significantly contributed to the growth of rubber-based TVDs. As regulatory standards for noise and vibration control in the automotive sector continue to tighten, the preference for rubber-based dampers is expected to remain strong, especially in passenger vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs).</p><p>Steel-based torsional vibration dampers, on the other hand, offer superior durability and performance in high-performance applications. These dampers are used in vehicles with powerful engines, such as heavy-duty trucks and performance cars, where higher vibration levels need to be controlled. Steel-based TVDs are known for their resistance to wear and tear and their ability to handle extreme operating conditions. The growing demand for high-performance, heavy-duty, and commercial vehicles in Germany is driving the adoption of steel-based dampers. With advancements in materials and engineering, steel-based TVDs are expected to maintain their position in the market, particularly in applications where robustness and longevity are crucial factors.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/801022/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Automotive Torsional Vibration Damper (TVD) Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Automotive Torsional Vibration Damper (TVD) Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Automotive Torsional Vibration Damper (TVD) Market size was valued at USD 2.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 4.0 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Automotive Torsional Vibration Damper (TVD) Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Vibracoustic</Li><Li> Schaeffler</Li><Li> Valeo</Li><Li> ZF</Li><Li> BorgWarner</Li><Li> Continental</Li><Li> AAM</Li><Li> Knorr-Bremse</Li><Li> FUKOKU</Li><Li> Geislinger</Li><Li> Vibratech TVD</Li><Li> Gates</Li><Li> Anhui Zhongding</Li><Li> Ningbo Sedsun</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Automotive Torsional Vibration Damper (TVD) Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Automotive Torsional Vibration Damper (TVD) Market apart.
