The oral tablet segment dominates the market due to the widespread use of this form for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. Oral tablets offer convenience, ease of administration, and consistent therapeutic effects, making them the preferred choice for patients and healthcare providers. The increasing prevalence of ADHD and the growing demand for effective treatment options contribute to the strong market share of oral tablets. Moreover, the development of extended-release formulations within the oral tablet category has further boosted market growth, providing longer-lasting effects with fewer side effects.<p>The injectable solution segment, while smaller, is gaining traction due to its potential in specialized medical applications, including hospital settings for patients who cannot tolerate oral medications. Injectable dextroamphetamine sulfate is used in cases where rapid onset of action is required or when oral administration is not possible. This segment is expected to grow as healthcare professionals look for alternatives to oral tablets in specific treatment scenarios. The evolving medical landscape, along with advancements in formulation techniques, is likely to lead to increased adoption of injectable solutions in the coming years. However, it remains a niche market compared to the dominant oral tablet form in Germany’s Dextroamphetamine Sulfate API market.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/661568/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Dextroamphetamine Sulfate API Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Dextroamphetamine Sulfate API Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Dextroamphetamine Sulfate API Market size was valued at USD 1.25 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.05 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Dextroamphetamine Sulfate API Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Veranova</Li><Li> Cambrex</Li><Li> Curia Global</Li><Li> Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals</Li><Li> Axyntis Group</Li><Li> Chattem Chemicals</Li><Li> Chr.
