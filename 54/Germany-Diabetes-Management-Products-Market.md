Blood glucose monitoring devices are essential for individuals with diabetes to monitor their blood sugar levels regularly. These devices include glucometers, continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGM), and test strips. Glucometers remain one of the most popular products, offering convenience and accuracy in daily glucose measurement. Continuous glucose monitoring systems, however, are gaining traction due to their ability to provide real-time data and help patients and healthcare providers adjust treatment plans more effectively. The increasing adoption of advanced technologies such as smart glucometers is expected to drive growth in this segment.<p>On the other hand, insulin delivery devices are also a key part of the market. These include insulin pens, syringes, insulin pumps, and insulin patches. Insulin pens are widely used for their ease of use, while insulin pumps offer more flexibility by delivering a continuous supply of insulin to patients. Insulin patches, a relatively new innovation, are expected to capture a significant market share due to their non-invasive nature and improved patient comfort. The growing demand for personalized and advanced insulin delivery systems is anticipated to propel the segment’s growth further.
