High-protein sunflower cake is gaining significant traction due to its high nutritional content, making it a preferred option for animal feed, especially for livestock and poultry. Its rich protein levels enhance the growth and productivity of animals, leading to increased demand from the agricultural sector. This segment benefits from the rising focus on sustainable feed alternatives, as high-protein sunflower cake provides an excellent source of amino acids and essential nutrients for livestock. Moreover, the increasing awareness about the environmental impact of conventional protein sources drives demand for these high-protein options in Germany, as they present a more eco-friendly alternative to soy-based feed.<p>On the other hand, the low-protein sunflower cake segment caters to different agricultural needs, offering a more cost-effective option for farmers and livestock breeders. This type is often used in the feeding of non-ruminant animals, such as poultry, where the protein content requirement is lower. The demand for low-protein sunflower cake is driven by the need for affordable and easily accessible feed materials, especially in smaller-scale farming operations. As farmers look for ways to optimize their feed costs without compromising the health and growth of their animals, low-protein sunflower cake is increasingly seen as a viable alternative. This type also supports the growing trend of more natural, plant-based feed options in the market, contributing to its steady growth in Germany's agricultural industry.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/658188/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Dehulled Sunflower Cake Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Dehulled Sunflower Cake Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Dehulled Sunflower Cake Market size was valued at USD 1.2 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 1.8 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Dehulled Sunflower Cake Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Archer Daniel Midland</Li><Li> Cargill</Li><Li> Wilmar International</Li><Li> Optimus Agro Holding</Li><Li> Melitopol Oil Extraction Plant</Li><Li> Aston</Li><Li> VIOIL Holding</Li><Li> Pology Oil Extraction Plant PJSC</Li><Li> Allseeds</Li><Li> SVMA Agro Products</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Dehulled Sunflower Cake Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Dehulled Sunflower Cake Market apart.
