Metformin, being the first-line treatment, is highly prescribed due to its efficacy in controlling blood glucose levels. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are also gaining traction due to their dual effects on managing blood sugar and aiding weight loss. The demand for oral drugs has been rising due to their convenience, cost-effectiveness, and lower incidence of hypoglycemia compared to insulin therapies.</p><p>Insulin-based therapies, on the other hand, are typically used for patients with </Li><Li>Oral Medicine</Li><Li> Injection Medicine diabetes or advanced Type 2 diabetes, where oral drugs are insufficient. Insulin formulations include rapid-acting, long-acting, and intermediate-acting insulin types, each serving different purposes depending on the patient’s glucose control needs. Insulin therapy is essential for patients with </Li><Li>Oral Medicine</Li><Li> Injection Medicine diabetes who have an absolute insulin deficiency. Rapid-acting insulins are commonly used to control post-meal blood glucose spikes, while long-acting insulins help maintain baseline glucose levels throughout the day.
