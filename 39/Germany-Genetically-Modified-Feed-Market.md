Genetically modified grains, such as corn and wheat, dominate the market due to their high yield and resistance to pests and diseases. These grains are crucial components in animal feed, especially for poultry and livestock farming. The increasing demand for animal protein has led to a greater reliance on these grains to ensure cost-effective and consistent feed production. The adoption of genetically modified grains has also helped address challenges related to food security and feed availability, thereby contributing to a more stable supply chain for the agriculture and livestock industries in Germany.</p><p>On the other hand, genetically modified oilseeds, including soybeans and canola, play a significant role in the market as well. These oilseeds are widely used in the production of protein meals and oils, which are essential for livestock nutrition. Genetically modified oilseeds are designed to resist herbicides and pests, enhancing crop yields and reducing the need for chemical interventions. The growing preference for plant-based proteins and oils in livestock feed formulations has led to an increase in the cultivation and use of genetically modified oilseeds. This shift is driving market growth and ensuring a steady supply of feed ingredients that meet the nutritional requirements of various animal species in Germany.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/540612/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Genetically Modified Feed Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Genetically Modified Feed Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Genetically Modified Feed Market size was valued at USD 7.2 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 12.5 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Genetically Modified Feed Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>DuPont</Li><Li> Dow</Li><Li> BASF</Li><Li> Bayer</Li><Li> Syngenta</Li><Li> Monsanto</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Genetically Modified Feed Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Genetically Modified Feed Market apart.
