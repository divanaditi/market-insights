Both types come with digital readouts and offer accuracy in weight measurement, making them popular choices among travelers who need precise readings for their baggage.In addition to handheld and hook-based designs, the market also includes Bluetooth-enabled digital hanging luggage scales. These innovative models allow travelers to sync the weight data with their smartphones, providing more convenience and additional features such as weight tracking and historical data analysis. Some advanced models also offer overload protection, ensuring that the scale provides reliable results even with heavy luggage. The growing demand for smart travel accessories in Germany is driving the adoption of these Bluetooth-enabled devices.
