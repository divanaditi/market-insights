The growing demand for clean-label ingredients in personal care, wellness, and pharmaceutical sectors is driving the demand for natural geranyl linalool. It is valued for its aromatic properties and skin-benefiting qualities, making it a key ingredient in premium cosmetics and therapeutic products.
