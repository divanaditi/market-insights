PPIs are the most commonly prescribed drugs due to their effectiveness in reducing stomach acid production, which helps in managing the symptoms of GERD. These drugs are considered the first-line treatment for moderate to severe cases of GERD, as they provide long-lasting relief by inhibiting the proton pumps in the stomach. As a result, PPIs account for a significant share of the market. The rising prevalence of GERD and the growing awareness about the benefits of PPIs are expected to continue driving their demand in Germany. Additionally, the availability of PPIs in both prescription and over-the-counter forms has further bolstered their usage in managing GERD symptoms.</p><p>On the other hand, H2-receptor antagonists are also widely used in the treatment of GERD, though they are generally recommended for less severe cases or as adjuncts to PPIs. These drugs work by blocking histamine receptors in the stomach lining, which in turn reduces stomach acid production. H2-receptor antagonists have a shorter duration of action compared to PPIs, but they offer an alternative for patients who may not tolerate PPIs or require milder treatment. The market for H2-receptor antagonists in Germany is driven by factors such as affordability and their effectiveness for milder forms of GERD. Additionally, the growing number of people self-diagnosing and opting for over-the-counter medications contributes to the steady demand for H2-receptor antagonists, even though PPIs remain the more dominant class of drugs in treating GERD in the country.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/859876/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease GERD Drug Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease GERD Drug Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease GERD Drug Market size was valued at USD 8.2 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 15.7 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 9.0% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease GERD Drug Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Pfizer</Li><Li> Novartis AG</Li><Li> GlaxoSmithKline</Li><Li> Merck</Li><Li> Medtronic</Li><Li> Pfizer</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease GERD Drug Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease GERD Drug Market apart.
