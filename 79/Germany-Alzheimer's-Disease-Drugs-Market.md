Symptomatic treatments include cholinesterase inhibitors and glutamate regulators. Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, are used to manage cognitive symptoms like memory loss and confusion by increasing levels of acetylcholine in the brain. These drugs are widely used in the early to moderate stages of Alzheimer's. Glutamate regulators, such as memantine, work by regulating the activity of glutamate, a neurotransmitter involved in learning and memory, helping to prevent further cognitive decline in moderate to severe stages of the disease.On the other hand, disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) aim to slow or halt the progression of Alzheimer's. This segment has seen recent advancements with drugs targeting amyloid plaques, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology. Monoclonal antibodies, such as aducanumab and lecanemab, are at the forefront of this category, showing promise in altering the course of the disease. These innovative treatments are expected to play a significant role in the future of Alzheimer's care, though their adoption is still evolving due to concerns about efficacy, cost, and accessibility. The market for disease-modifying therapies is anticipated to grow as more breakthroughs in Alzheimer’s research emerge.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/860848/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Alzheimer's Disease Drugs Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Alzheimer's Disease Drugs Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Alzheimer's Disease Drugs Market size was valued at USD 4.4 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 10.9 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 12.1% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Alzheimer's Disease Drugs Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Eisai</Li><Li> Forest Laboratories</Li><Li> H.
