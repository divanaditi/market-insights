Adult diapers dominate the market due to their extensive use in both elderly care and individuals with medical conditions. These products are available in different sizes and absorbency levels, catering to the diverse needs of consumers. Incontinence pads and bladder pads are also widely utilized, especially among those with mild to moderate incontinence. These products are known for their convenience, discreetness, and comfort, making them a preferred choice for many. Protective underwear is another growing segment, offering a more dignified and discreet option for those dealing with incontinence, particularly in active adults. The variety of products available in the market allows consumers to choose based on their specific needs, preferences, and severity of incontinence.<p>In addition to the major product categories mentioned above, other types such as skin care products and absorbent bed pads contribute to the overall market growth.
