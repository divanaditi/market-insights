Targeted therapies focus on specific molecules or pathways involved in cancer cell growth and spread. These treatments are designed to target only the cancer cells, minimizing damage to healthy tissue. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors are among the leading drugs in this segment. TKIs block proteins that promote cancer cell division, while VEGF inhibitors aim to prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. With advancements in drug development, targeted therapies have become increasingly effective in providing long-term remission for kidney cancer patients.<p>Immunotherapies represent another significant segment in the market, using the body's immune system to fight kidney cancer. Checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors, are at the forefront of this category. These drugs work by blocking the checkpoint proteins that inhibit immune cells from attacking cancer cells. Immunotherapies have shown considerable promise in improving survival rates for patients with advanced or metastatic renal cancer. The growing popularity of combination therapies, which pair immunotherapy with targeted treatments, is expected to drive market growth. Both immunotherapies and targeted therapies are transforming the treatment landscape, offering patients new hope and increasing treatment options for kidney cancer in Germany.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/857016/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Kidney/Renal Cancer Drugs Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Kidney/Renal Cancer Drugs Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Kidney/Renal Cancer Drugs Market size was valued at USD 6.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 11.8 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 8.0% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Kidney/Renal Cancer Drugs Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>F.
