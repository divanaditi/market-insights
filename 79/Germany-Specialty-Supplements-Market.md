Dietary supplements account for a large portion of the market, as they offer a wide range of products such as vitamins, minerals, and herbal extracts. These products are primarily consumed for their health benefits, including enhancing overall wellness, boosting immunity, and supporting mental and physical performance. Functional foods are another key segment, gaining popularity for their ability to provide health benefits beyond basic nutrition. These products, often enriched with probiotics, omega-3 fatty acids, or antioxidants, cater to the growing demand for preventive healthcare and healthy lifestyles. The demand for personal care supplements, which focus on beauty and skin health, is also increasing, with consumers looking for products that promote youthful appearance and combat aging signs.</p><p>Among these segments, the demand for herbal and plant-based supplements is experiencing significant growth. This shift is driven by consumer interest in natural and sustainable products. Additionally, sports nutrition supplements are a rapidly growing category, as athletes and fitness enthusiasts increasingly turn to protein powders, amino acids, and energy boosters to enhance performance and recovery. Another emerging trend is the use of cognitive enhancers, which include supplements designed to improve brain function, focus, and memory. As consumers in Germany continue to prioritize health, wellness, and sustainability, the market for specialty supplements is expected to diversify further, with innovations in both product formulations and delivery methods.
