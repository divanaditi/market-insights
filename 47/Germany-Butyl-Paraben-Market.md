The most commonly used type is the liquid form, which is favored for its ease of incorporation in cosmetics and personal care products.

Additionally, the liquid form is valued for its stability in a wide range of formulations, including lotions, creams, and shampoos. As consumers become more aware of ingredient safety, liquid butyl paraben continues to be utilized due to its well-established effectiveness in preventing contamination without compromising the quality of the product.<p>Another significant type in the market is the powder form of butyl paraben, which is commonly employed in the production of dry formulations such as powders and certain tablets.
