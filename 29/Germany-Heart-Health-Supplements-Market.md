Additionally, supplements containing Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) have gained significant attention for their antioxidant properties and ability to support cardiovascular function by improving energy production within cells. Other popular types in this category include plant sterols and stanols, which help lower cholesterol levels, and magnesium supplements, which are essential for proper heart rhythm and overall cardiac health. These supplements are widely adopted due to their scientifically-backed benefits for improving heart function and maintaining cardiovascular health in the long term.</p><p>Another key type in the German heart health supplements market includes dietary fibers and antioxidants such as polyphenols. These are widely recognized for their role in improving arterial health and preventing oxidative damage that can lead to cardiovascular diseases. Fiber supplements, especially soluble fiber, are beneficial in lowering cholesterol levels and supporting healthy blood sugar levels, thereby reducing the risk of heart-related ailments. Antioxidants, including flavonoids and vitamin E, are also critical in protecting blood vessels from free radicals and supporting overall heart health. Moreover, B-complex vitamins such as B6, B12, and folic acid contribute to homocysteine metabolism, helping to reduce cardiovascular risks.
