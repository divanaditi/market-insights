Medications, including somatostatin analogs like octreotide and lanreotide, are widely used in treating carcinoid syndrome-related diarrhea. These drugs work by inhibiting the secretion of serotonin and other hormones that contribute to the diarrhea. Somatostatin analogs remain the first-line treatment for managing the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. Additionally, the market has seen a rise in the use of selective serotonin receptor antagonists, such as telotristat ethyl, which specifically targets serotonin in the gastrointestinal system to control diarrhea. This segment is expected to grow due to the effectiveness of these therapies in reducing the frequency and severity of symptoms. The increasing availability of new drug formulations is also expected to enhance market growth over the coming years.</p><p>Surgical procedures for treating carcinoid syndrome diarrhea in Germany are another significant segment within the market.
