MDIs are the most commonly used devices for the delivery of corticosteroids, as they are cost-effective and widely available. These devices operate by releasing a pre-measured dose of medication in aerosol form, making them easy to use for patients. MDIs are suitable for individuals with various respiratory conditions, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The growth of MDIs in Germany is driven by their popularity among healthcare providers and patients due to their compact size, portability, and efficacy in treating respiratory ailments. Additionally, the continuous advancements in MDI technology, such as breath-actuated and dose counters, have further contributed to their market expansion.<p>Dry Powder Inhalers (DPIs) have gained significant traction in the Germany inhaler corticosteroid device market due to their ease of use and efficient drug delivery system. Unlike MDIs, DPIs do not require coordination between inhalation and activation, making them more user-friendly, especially for elderly and pediatric patients. DPIs deliver medication in a fine powder form that is inhaled directly into the lungs. The rise in demand for DPIs is attributed to their advantages, such as better patient compliance, reduced side effects, and more precise dosing. In recent years, the increasing awareness about the benefits of DPIs, coupled with the growing incidence of respiratory diseases, has propelled the market for these devices. Furthermore, the development of new-generation DPIs with improved design features, such as smaller and more portable devices, has enhanced their acceptance in the German market.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/475674/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Inhaler Corticosteroid Device Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Inhaler Corticosteroid Device Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Inhaler Corticosteroid Device Market size was valued at USD 18.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 30.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.3% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Inhaler Corticosteroid Device Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Pfizer Inc.</Li><Li> GlaxoSmithKline Plc</Li><Li> Novartis AG</Li><Li> Mylan NV</Li><Li> Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.</Li><Li> Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH</Li><Li> AstraZeneca</Li><Li> F.
