Sodium iodide (NaI) crystals dominate the market due to their excellent scintillation properties, such as high light yield and efficient detection of gamma rays. NaI crystals are commonly used in radiation detection and medical imaging devices due to their ability to deliver clear and accurate readings. These crystals also find application in nuclear and particle physics research due to their fast response times and relatively low cost compared to other alternatives. Other popular types of inorganic scintillation crystals include cesium iodide (CsI), which provides enhanced performance in high-energy applications, and thallium-doped crystals that offer superior efficiency for specific radiation detection requirements. These types have increasingly found applications in nuclear medicine, industrial testing, and environmental monitoring.<p>The growing demand for more sensitive and accurate radiation detection has spurred the development of advanced inorganic scintillation crystals in Germany. Calcium fluoride (CaF2) crystals are gaining traction due to their broad detection range and resistance to radiation damage, making them ideal for high radiation environments. Additionally, rare-earth-based crystals, such as lutetium-based (Lu-based) scintillators, are seeing a rise in popularity due to their exceptional performance in high-energy gamma ray detection and medical imaging.
