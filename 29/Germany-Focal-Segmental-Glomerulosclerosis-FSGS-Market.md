Primary FSGS is an idiopathic condition that often leads to kidney damage, causing the scarring of glomeruli in the kidneys, which can result in proteinuria, kidney dysfunction, and, eventually, kidney failure. It is the most common form of FSGS, accounting for a significant proportion of FSGS cases in Germany. Treatment for primary FSGS is typically focused on managing symptoms, slowing the progression of kidney damage, and preventing end-stage renal disease. The prevalence of primary FSGS is rising in Germany, driven by increasing awareness, early diagnosis, and improved access to healthcare. This growing awareness is expected to drive demand for more effective treatment options, including immunosuppressive therapies and novel drug candidates for managing primary FSGS cases.</p><p>Secondary FSGS is a type of FSGS that occurs due to another underlying health condition, such as obesity, infections, or genetic disorders. The secondary FSGS segment in Germany is expected to grow as rising incidences of diseases like hypertension, diabetes, and HIV lead to more cases of this form of kidney damage. Unlike primary FSGS, secondary FSGS is treatable by managing the root cause, and effective control of the underlying disease can significantly reduce kidney-related complications. This segment is also likely to witness increased attention from pharmaceutical companies that are focusing on innovative therapies to manage secondary FSGS.
