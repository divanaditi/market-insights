Some baby mouthwashes are alcohol-free and contain natural ingredients to soothe and protect sensitive gums. Additionally, baby teething gels are also gaining popularity, as they help alleviate the discomfort associated with teething while also promoting gum health. These products are typically available in soothing flavors and are designed to provide relief from pain and irritation.
