Molecular diagnostics, including PCR-based tests and other nucleic acid amplification techniques, offer precise detection of pathogens causing respiratory diseases like influenza and COVID-19. These methods are highly valued for their accuracy and rapid results, especially during outbreaks. The growing need for accurate and quick diagnosis in hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic labs is pushing the demand for these molecular diagnostic tools. Additionally, the continuous development of more efficient PCR platforms and related technologies further supports this segment's growth in Germany.</p><p>Another significant segment within the market is antigen-based diagnostics, which are becoming increasingly popular due to their cost-effectiveness and ease of use. Antigen tests provide quick results, making them suitable for point-of-care settings. These diagnostics are commonly used for detecting diseases such as influenza, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), and COVID-19. Their ability to offer fast screening with relatively lower costs compared to molecular tests has led to their widespread adoption in Germany, especially in situations requiring mass testing. As healthcare providers seek efficient diagnostic solutions, antigen-based diagnostics are anticipated to witness continued market growth.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/476960/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Infectious Respiratory Disease Diagnostics Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Infectious Respiratory Disease Diagnostics Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Infectious Respiratory Disease Diagnostics Market size was valued at USD 4.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 8.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 8.1% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Infectious Respiratory Disease Diagnostics Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Abbott</Li><Li> Thermo Fisher Scientific</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> Koninklijke Philips N.V.</Li><Li> F.
