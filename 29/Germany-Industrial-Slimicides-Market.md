Oxidizing slimicides, which include chlorine-based compounds, are commonly used in industrial applications to control the growth of algae and bacteria in water systems. These chemicals work by releasing oxygen, which disrupts the cellular structure of microorganisms, preventing them from multiplying. Oxidizing slimicides are especially effective in applications involving cooling towers, oil fields, and industrial water treatment plants. Due to their powerful antimicrobial properties, these compounds offer long-lasting effects, although their usage must be carefully managed to prevent corrosion in the infrastructure. The demand for oxidizing slimicides is driven by industries that require large-scale water treatments and by regulations that enforce higher standards for water quality.<p>Non-oxidizing slimicides, on the other hand, are typically used in applications where a more stable and longer-lasting solution is required. These include biocides such as isothiazolinones, quaternary ammonium compounds, and formaldehyde-releasing agents. Non-oxidizing slimicides are effective at low concentrations and tend to be less corrosive compared to their oxidizing counterparts, making them suitable for sensitive industrial systems. These slimicides work by interfering with microbial cell processes, preventing the formation of biofilms, and inhibiting growth.
