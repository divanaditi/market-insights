Y-type strainers are one of the most common and cost-effective solutions, especially suited for smaller pipelines or systems with limited space. These strainers are primarily designed for ease of maintenance and high-efficiency filtration, and they are frequently used in applications involving liquids and gases. Their angled design allows for minimal pressure drop, making them ideal for systems requiring low maintenance and high performance. This has led to an increasing demand in various industrial sectors in Germany, including oil and gas, water treatment, and chemical industries.<p>Basket strainers, on the other hand, are typically used in larger pipeline systems where more robust filtration is necessary. With their large surface area, basket strainers can trap a larger volume of particulate matter before requiring maintenance. They are favored in industries like mining, power generation, and manufacturing, where they ensure that equipment operates efficiently without clogging. Duplex strainers, featuring two separate baskets, offer a continuous filtration process with one basket in use while the other is cleaned, making them particularly useful in critical operations that cannot afford downtime.
