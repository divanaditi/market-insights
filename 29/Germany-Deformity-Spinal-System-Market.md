Spinal rods and screws are among the most commonly used devices in the treatment of spinal deformities such as scoliosis and kyphosis. These devices work together to stabilize the spine and correct deformities through surgical intervention. The advanced materials and precision-engineering of these systems have increased their effectiveness in delivering long-term results for patients with complex spinal conditions. Surgeons often select rods and screws based on the patient's specific deformity and structural requirements to ensure optimal spinal alignment and minimize the risk of complications during the recovery process.</p><p>Additionally, plates and other supporting devices such as connectors and hooks contribute to the stabilization of the spine in deformity correction surgeries. Plates are used to further enhance the stability of spinal fusion procedures, providing additional support during the healing process. These devices are often employed in combination with rods and screws, depending on the complexity of the deformity.
