Handheld polarization cameras are designed for portable, on-the-go applications, providing users with the flexibility to capture high-quality polarized images in various industrial environments. These cameras are widely used in automotive, manufacturing, and quality control sectors, where portability and ease of use are essential. They offer compact designs, robust construction, and ease of operation, making them ideal for fieldwork and quick inspections. The demand for handheld cameras has surged due to their versatility in capturing images with minimal setup, enabling industries to quickly detect surface defects, stress patterns, and material properties in real time.<p>On the other hand, mounted polarization cameras are typically fixed in place for continuous monitoring and more extensive image capture in large-scale industrial operations. These cameras are often integrated into automated systems for tasks such as inspection, surveillance, and research in industrial production lines. Mounted polarization cameras provide high precision and enhanced image clarity, making them crucial for applications where static imaging over extended periods is required. Industries like aerospace, electronics manufacturing, and scientific research benefit from the ability to monitor processes without disruption.
