Synthetic meshes are widely used due to their durability and cost-effectiveness. These meshes are made from materials such as polypropylene, polyester, and ePTFE, which provide strength and flexibility to support tissue healing. Polypropylene meshes dominate the market, owing to their affordability and long-standing use in hernia repair surgeries. The synthetic mesh segment is expected to grow due to technological advancements in mesh design, which aim to reduce complications like infection and recurrence of hernias. These meshes are increasingly preferred by surgeons because of their predictable performance and availability in a variety of forms, such as flat, knitted, and preformed meshes for different surgical approaches.<p>Biological meshes, on the other hand, are gaining traction in the Germany inguinal hernia repair mesh market, driven by their natural composition and reduced risk of rejection or infection. These meshes are derived from human or animal tissues, such as porcine or bovine sources, and are designed to promote better tissue integration and healing. Although they are more expensive than synthetic meshes, biological meshes are often used in complex or recurrent hernia cases, where the risk of infection is higher.
