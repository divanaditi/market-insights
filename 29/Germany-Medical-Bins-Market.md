Another significant segment is hazardous waste bins, which are specifically designed for the disposal of biohazardous materials, sharp objects, and chemicals. These bins are typically color-coded, with features such as secure lids and leak-proof designs to prevent contamination and ensure safe disposal, which is critical in healthcare settings.

These bins cater to the unique needs of different departments within healthcare facilities. The continuous evolution in the design and functionality of medical bins, driven by technological advancements and regulatory requirements, further fuels the growth of this segment in the German market.
