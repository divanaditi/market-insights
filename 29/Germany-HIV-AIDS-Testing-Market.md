These include traditional laboratory-based tests, rapid diagnostic tests, and home testing kits. Laboratory-based tests remain the most commonly used method, offering high accuracy and reliability. They typically involve blood samples analyzed in medical facilities. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), on the other hand, are gaining popularity due to their ease of use and quicker results, making them ideal for point-of-care settings or at-risk populations. RDTs often require less technical expertise and are useful in areas with limited access to healthcare facilities. Additionally, home testing kits have seen increased adoption, offering patients privacy and convenience, as they can perform the test themselves and send samples to labs for results. This growing interest in at-home testing reflects a shift towards more accessible HIV-AIDS diagnosis methods in Germany.</p><p>Another key segment of the market includes nucleic acid tests (NATs), which are employed for detecting viral load and confirming HIV infection at an early stage. NATs offer high sensitivity and accuracy, particularly in diagnosing HIV during the acute phase of infection when antibodies may not yet be detectable.
