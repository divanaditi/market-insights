Among these, the classical pathway tests hold significant market share, as they help evaluate deficiencies in proteins like C1, C2, and C4, which are crucial for the immune response. These tests are vital for diagnosing autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, and help in understanding the severity of complement deficiencies. Additionally, alternative pathway testing, which focuses on components like factor B and properdin, is increasingly in demand due to its role in identifying immune deficiencies related to infections, chronic inflammation, and autoimmune conditions. Such specialized tests allow clinicians to obtain precise information, guiding appropriate treatment strategies for affected individuals. Moreover, market expansion is influenced by the growing prevalence of autoimmune diseases and the rising awareness about complement system disorders.<p>The lectin pathway-based complement deficiency tests are another segment within the Germany market that is gaining momentum. These tests evaluate the presence and activity of components like mannan-binding lectin (MBL), which plays a vital role in immune responses against pathogens. Deficiencies in this pathway can lead to an increased susceptibility to infections. As immunological research advances, tests targeting this pathway have become essential for diagnosing specific immune deficiencies and related conditions. Moreover, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and other biochemical techniques continue to be dominant in the market due to their accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.
