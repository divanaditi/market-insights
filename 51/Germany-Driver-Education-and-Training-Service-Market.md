Traditional driving schools have long been the backbone of driver education, offering in-person lessons with certified instructors. These schools provide both theoretical lessons on road safety, traffic laws, and practical driving experience. Many established driving schools across Germany offer customized packages, including defensive driving courses and specialized training for young or elderly drivers. These services are typically delivered in a structured environment, where students learn to drive in a safe and controlled setting. As demand for safe driving increases, traditional driving schools continue to be a popular choice for new drivers seeking formal, face-to-face instruction, especially in urban centers where road traffic can be particularly challenging. The demand for this type of training is expected to maintain a steady growth trajectory in the coming years.</p><p>On the other hand, online driving courses are gaining momentum in Germany as technological advancements and consumer preferences shift towards digital learning. These platforms offer theoretical lessons, such as road rules, safety measures, and traffic signs, through interactive modules that users can complete at their own pace.

Although online courses cannot fully replace hands-on driving experience, they serve as a supplementary or introductory resource for learners. The ability to access these courses from the comfort of one's home has led to a growing interest in this segment.
