Bituminous cold patches are the most commonly used due to their superior bonding properties, durability, and resistance to weathering. These patches are made from asphalt emulsions or asphalt mixtures and are typically used for repairing potholes, cracks, and surface degradation in roads, highways, and urban streets. Their performance in both high and low-temperature conditions makes them a preferred choice for many municipalities and contractors. The increasing demand for quick and cost-effective road repairs in urban areas drives the adoption of bituminous cold patches in Germany's infrastructure maintenance projects.<p>On the other hand, non-bituminous cold patches include products made from materials like rubber, polymer, and other synthetic mixtures. These patches are gaining popularity due to their eco-friendly properties and better environmental impact. Non-bituminous cold patches are known for their ease of application and enhanced flexibility, which allows them to provide long-lasting repairs even in challenging weather conditions. While they may be relatively less cost-effective than bituminous patches, their growing adoption is driven by their lower environmental footprint and the rising preference for sustainable solutions.
