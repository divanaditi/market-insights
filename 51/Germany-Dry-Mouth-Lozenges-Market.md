Medicated lozenges are formulated with active ingredients such as fluoride, xylitol, or artificial saliva that help in moisturizing the mouth and reducing discomfort. These lozenges are designed to alleviate symptoms of dry mouth caused by conditions such as Sjögren's syndrome, diabetes, or medication side effects. The increasing prevalence of these conditions in Germany is driving the demand for medicated lozenges. Moreover, rising healthcare awareness and advancements in oral care products are further contributing to the growth of this segment. Medicated lozenges are favored for their therapeutic properties, providing lasting relief and promoting oral health.<p>On the other hand, non-medicated lozenges focus on providing moisture and soothing effects without medicinal additives. These lozenges typically contain ingredients like honey, glycerin, or herbal extracts, which provide hydration and mild relief from dry mouth symptoms. Non-medicated lozenges are generally preferred by consumers looking for a more natural solution or those who experience mild forms of dry mouth. The non-medicated segment is gaining popularity due to the growing demand for natural and organic products. As consumers become more health-conscious, the market for non-medicated dry mouth lozenges in Germany is expanding rapidly. The rise in self-care trends and the desire for products with fewer artificial ingredients are key factors driving the demand in this segment.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/632442/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Dry Mouth Lozenges Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Dry Mouth Lozenges Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Dry Mouth Lozenges Market size was valued at USD 0.75 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 1.20 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.0% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Dry Mouth Lozenges Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>BiotÃ¨ne</Li><Li> OraCoat</Li><Li> ACT</Li><Li> Fontus</Li><Li> Oral-B</Li><Li> Rite Aid</Li><Li> Zicam</Li><Li> Lubricity</Li><Li> TheraBreath</Li><Li> Med Active</Li><Li> Hagar Pharma</Li><Li> Smart Mouth</Li><Li> DenTek</Li><Li> Nuvora</Li><Li> Nature's Answer</Li><Li> Hyalogic</Li><Li> Camellix</Li><Li> Colgate</Li><Li> Chattem</Li><Li> Johnson & Johnson</Li><Li> BioXtra</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Dry Mouth Lozenges Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Dry Mouth Lozenges Market apart.
