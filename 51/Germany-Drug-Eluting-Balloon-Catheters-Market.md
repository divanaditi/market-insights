The primary types include paclitaxel-coated balloons, sirolimus-coated balloons, and others. Among these, paclitaxel-coated drug-eluting balloons have emerged as the most dominant segment in the market. Paclitaxel is a well-known anti-proliferative agent, which helps in reducing restenosis and preventing the reoccurrence of blockages in coronary arteries. Due to its proven efficacy, paclitaxel-coated balloons are extensively used in treating coronary artery diseases, especially in patients with small or complex lesions. The growing adoption of paclitaxel-coated drug-eluting balloons can be attributed to their ability to enhance the outcomes of angioplasty and improve long-term patient prognosis.<p>On the other hand, sirolimus-coated drug-eluting balloons are gaining traction due to their advanced drug release mechanism, which offers benefits like reduced risk of restenosis and improved vessel healing. These balloons are primarily used in patients with complex coronary artery disease and in those requiring repeat interventions. Sirolimus is known for its potent anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties, making it a valuable choice for balloon catheters. As more clinical evidence supports the superior outcomes of sirolimus-coated balloons, their demand is expected to rise, contributing to the growth of the Germany DEB catheters market. The increasing preference for these advanced treatment modalities underscores the shift towards more targeted therapies that provide better clinical results and minimize complications in cardiovascular procedures.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/634358/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Drug-Eluting Balloon Catheters Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Drug-Eluting Balloon Catheters Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Drug-Eluting Balloon Catheters Market size was valued at USD 1.2 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.1 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.8% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Drug-Eluting Balloon Catheters Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>B.
