These chopped variants are especially preferred in ready-to-eat meals, soups, and sauces. Minced onions, which are finely chopped and dehydrated, also have a high demand as they provide an intense flavor without the need for additional preparation. They are commonly used in seasonings, spice mixes, and as flavor enhancers in processed foods.</p><p>Another key segment in the market is powdered dried onions, which are often used in culinary applications where a smooth texture is preferred, such as in dips, dressings, and powder-based seasonings.
