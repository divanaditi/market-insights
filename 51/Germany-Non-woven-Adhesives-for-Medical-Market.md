Pressure-sensitive adhesives dominate the market due to their excellent bonding properties, ease of application, and suitability for medical devices that require gentle, reliable adhesion. These adhesives are extensively used in products like wound care dressings, surgical tapes, and transdermal drug delivery systems. PSAs offer advantages such as skin-friendliness, long-lasting adhesion, and the ability to bond without the need for heat or additional curing, making them ideal for sensitive medical applications. The demand for PSAs is rising as healthcare providers seek adhesives that provide comfort and security while minimizing the risk of skin irritation or injury. On the other hand, hot-melt adhesives are gaining traction due to their fast-setting characteristics and high-performance bonding. Hot-melt adhesives are frequently used in medical devices that require stronger bonds, such as in the manufacturing of prosthetics, surgical drapes, and medical packaging. These adhesives offer robust bonding strength, enhanced durability, and resistance to environmental factors like moisture and temperature changes. Hot-melt adhesives provide a clean, solvent-free solution that is increasingly in demand as regulatory standards for medical products tighten. The versatility of hot-melt adhesives makes them suitable for a wide range of medical applications, helping to drive their growth in the German market. As both PSAs and hot-melt adhesives continue to evolve, the market is expected to see significant advancements in the development of more specialized formulations tailored to specific medical needs.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/632736/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Non-woven Adhesives for Medical Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Non-woven Adhesives for Medical Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Non-woven Adhesives for Medical Market size was valued at USD 1.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.6 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Non-woven Adhesives for Medical Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Henkel</Li><Li> H.B.
