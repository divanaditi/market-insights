Coronary drug-coated balloons are designed for treating coronary artery diseases and are widely used in percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). These balloons are coated with pharmacological agents that prevent restenosis, reducing the need for additional stent placement. The rising prevalence of coronary artery diseases, coupled with advancements in catheter technologies, is boosting the demand for coronary drug-coated balloons in Germany. As a result, hospitals and healthcare facilities are increasingly adopting these products to provide better outcomes for patients undergoing coronary artery treatments.</p><p>On the other hand, peripheral drug-coated balloons are gaining traction in the treatment of peripheral artery diseases (PAD). These catheters are specifically designed for use in arteries outside of the coronary region, particularly in the legs, where peripheral arterial blockages are common. Peripheral drug-coated balloons are equipped with drugs that help to manage restenosis and improve long-term patency rates, reducing the need for repeat interventions. With the growing prevalence of PAD in the aging population and advancements in catheter technology, the market for peripheral drug-coated balloons is expanding rapidly in Germany, offering patients a minimally invasive treatment option with favorable clinical outcomes.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/634490/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Drug-coated Balloon Dilatation Catheters Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Drug-coated Balloon Dilatation Catheters Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Drug-coated Balloon Dilatation Catheters Market size was valued at USD 1.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 3.1 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 9.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Drug-coated Balloon Dilatation Catheters Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Acotec</Li><Li> Boston Scientific</Li><Li> Abbott</Li><Li> Terumo Europe</Li><Li> MicroPort Scientific</Li><Li> Medtronic</Li><Li> Cordis</Li><Li> B.
