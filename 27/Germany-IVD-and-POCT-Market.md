Immunoassays, which are widely used for detecting specific proteins, hormones, and other biomarkers, dominate the market. These tests are essential for diagnosing diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, and cancers. Molecular diagnostics, which allow for the identification of genetic material, are also growing rapidly, driven by advancements in personalized medicine and the increasing need for precise and accurate diagnostic tools. Clinical chemistry tests, which focus on analyzing bodily fluids to assess health status, are widely utilized in clinical laboratories. Hematology tests, focusing on blood cell analysis, and microbiology diagnostics, used for identifying infectious pathogens, round out the diverse landscape of diagnostic tools used in the country.</p><p>Point-of-Care Testing (POCT) has become increasingly popular due to its convenience and ability to provide rapid results outside traditional laboratory settings. The types of POCT devices are categorized based on the type of test, such as glucose monitoring, cardiac markers, pregnancy tests, and infectious disease testing. Among these, glucose monitoring devices are highly sought after due to the increasing prevalence of diabetes in Germany. POCT for cardiac markers, which can help diagnose acute cardiac events like heart attacks, is another important segment. Pregnancy tests remain a common application, and their availability in home settings has significantly contributed to the growth of the POCT market. Infectious disease testing, especially for conditions like COVID-19 and influenza, has also seen a surge in demand due to the ongoing focus on public health. These tests are crucial in enabling fast diagnosis and immediate decision-making in various healthcare environments.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/465672/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany IVD and POCT Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany IVD and POCT Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>IVD and POCT Market Market size was valued at USD 76 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 118 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.9% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany IVD and POCT Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Roche</Li><Li> Abbott</Li><Li> Johnson & Johnson</Li><Li> Siemens Healthcare</Li><Li> Danaher</Li><Li> Ascensia</Li><Li> Bio-Rad Laboratories</Li><Li> BioMerieux</Li><Li> ARKRAY</Li><Li> Nova Biomedical</Li><Li> Trividia Health</Li><Li> Quidel</Li><Li> Accriva</Li><Li> OraSure Technologies</Li><Li> Helena Laboratories</Li><Li> A.
