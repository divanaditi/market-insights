Conventional phototherapy typically involves fluorescent lamps or halogen bulbs that emit blue light, which helps break down bilirubin in the skin. These systems have been widely used for decades due to their proven effectiveness and cost-efficiency. However, they require frequent maintenance and can be bulky, which limits their portability and ease of use in home care settings. Despite these drawbacks, they remain an integral part of the market due to their low initial investment and established track record in clinical environments.</p><p>On the other hand, LED phototherapy has gained significant popularity in recent years due to advancements in technology. LED lights provide more focused wavelengths of light, which are efficient in treating jaundice while minimizing heat production. This type of therapy is increasingly preferred for its compact design, reduced energy consumption, and portability, making it ideal for use in both hospital and home care settings. The rising adoption of LED-based treatment systems is expected to drive growth in the market as they offer enhanced treatment outcomes, ease of use, and lower operational costs compared to conventional phototherapy options.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/465336/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Jaundice Treatment Light Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Jaundice Treatment Light Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Jaundice Treatment Light Market size was valued at USD 0.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 1.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 10% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Jaundice Treatment Light Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>DrÃ¤gerwerk AG & Co.
