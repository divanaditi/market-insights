These containers are widely employed for their robust structure and ability to protect goods from external environmental factors. They adhere to strict ISO standards, ensuring compatibility across international logistics systems. Additionally, the refrigerated containers, also known as reefers, are increasingly in demand, particularly for perishable goods such as food and pharmaceuticals. These containers are designed to maintain a controlled temperature and humidity, making them essential for cold chain logistics in Germany's industrial and commercial sectors.</p><p>Another notable segment within the market includes the tank containers, which are specifically designed to transport liquids and chemicals. These containers comply with rigorous safety standards to ensure secure handling of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids. Furthermore, the flat-rack containers segment is gaining traction, primarily used for transporting oversized cargo such as heavy machinery and construction materials.
