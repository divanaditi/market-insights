The skewb cube, with its mechanism that twists around its corners, is also a favored choice among avid solvers who seek complexity and variety in their puzzles. These types represent the diversification in the Rubik's Cube market in Germany, catering to different preferences and levels of difficulty. <p>The second key type in the German market is the dodecahedron cube, a 12-sided puzzle, also known as the megaminx, which provides a more complex challenge compared to the traditional 3x3 cube.
