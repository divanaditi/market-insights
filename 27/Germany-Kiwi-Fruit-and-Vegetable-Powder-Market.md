The versatility of kiwi fruit powder, along with its potential to support digestion and immune health, drives its increasing consumption in Germany. As consumers continue to prioritize wellness and seek innovative ways to incorporate more nutrients into their diet, kiwi fruit powder is becoming a staple in both household and commercial applications.  <p>On the other hand, vegetable powders, which are derived from a variety of vegetables, also play a significant role in the market.
