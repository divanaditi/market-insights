Known for its durability, resistance to scratches, and variety of designs, granite countertops are a preferred choice among homeowners and designers. They offer both aesthetic appeal and practical functionality, making them suitable for both traditional and contemporary kitchen styles. Additionally, quartz countertops have gained significant market share due to their low maintenance, wide range of colors, and enhanced durability. Quartz is engineered to be non-porous, making it resistant to stains and bacteria, which is a crucial consideration in kitchens. This has led to a rise in its demand, particularly in urban areas where convenience and hygiene are priorities. Both granite and quartz are expected to continue to dominate the German kitchen countertop market due to their premium features and long-term value.<p>On the other hand, laminate countertops are becoming an increasingly popular choice due to their cost-effectiveness and customization options.

Wood surfaces are valued for their natural look and warmth, offering a more organic feel in the kitchen.
