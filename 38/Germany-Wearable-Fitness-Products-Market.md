These shoes typically feature embedded sensors to track stride length, cadence, and foot pressure, providing valuable data for athletes and fitness enthusiasts to improve their training. Additionally, the Germany wearable fitness market is witnessing growth in the field of wearable ECG monitors, which offer continuous heart health monitoring, providing users with in-depth insights into their cardiovascular health. This technology is becoming increasingly popular among those who require real-time heart condition tracking, such as individuals with pre-existing health conditions or those involved in intense physical activities.
