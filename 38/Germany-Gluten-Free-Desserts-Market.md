These products cater to a broad demographic, ranging from individuals with celiac disease to those following gluten-free diets for lifestyle reasons. Additionally, advancements in gluten-free baking ingredients, such as almond flour, rice flour, and tapioca starch, have contributed to improving the taste and texture of these desserts, making them more palatable and satisfying for consumers. The market has also seen innovation in terms of flavor offerings, with new varieties of gluten-free cakes and cookies introduced regularly to cater to diverse consumer preferences.</p><p>Another significant segment in the Germany gluten-free desserts market is the range of frozen desserts, including ice creams, sorbets, and other chilled products. These desserts are becoming increasingly popular due to their convenience and variety.
