The most common type is the wearable GPS tracker, often designed as wristbands or smartwatches. These devices are lightweight, easy to use, and can be worn comfortably by children throughout the day. They typically come with features like real-time location tracking, two-way communication, and emergency buttons for instant alerts. Many of these wearable devices also have additional functionalities such as activity monitoring, fitness tracking, and SOS alerts, providing added value to parents. As wearable trackers are becoming increasingly popular, manufacturers are focusing on enhancing their durability, battery life, and ease of use to meet the demands of busy families.<p>Another popular type of GPS tracker for kids in Germany is the portable tracker. These compact devices are often designed to be carried in a backpack or attached to a belt loop.

Some portable GPS devices also provide features like speed tracking and historical route records, helping parents monitor their child's movements over time.
