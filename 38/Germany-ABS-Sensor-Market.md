Active sensors are typically employed in advanced ABS systems due to their precision and ability to provide more accurate data. These sensors generate their own electrical signal, which is then transmitted to the control module for better performance. Active sensors offer improved reliability, especially in high-speed applications, making them highly popular in modern vehicles. As a result, the demand for active sensors is growing as automakers continue to incorporate more sophisticated ABS systems into their vehicles, focusing on enhanced safety features and performance optimization.</p><p>On the other hand, passive ABS sensors are commonly used in older vehicle models and basic ABS configurations. Unlike active sensors, passive sensors do not generate their own signal and instead rely on the vehicle's system to provide the necessary data. Although passive sensors are less expensive and simpler, they still play a significant role in maintaining safety and stability in vehicles with basic ABS systems. The demand for passive ABS sensors remains steady in the aftermarket and among older vehicles, but the market is slowly shifting toward more advanced active sensor technologies due to their superior performance and safety advantages.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/539118/?utm_source=Pulse6-Dec&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany ABS Sensor Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany ABS Sensor Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>ABS Sensor Market size was valued at USD 3.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 5.7 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.3% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany ABS Sensor Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Continental AG</Li><Li> Delphi</Li><Li> Denso</Li><Li> Bosch</Li><Li> NGK Spark Plug</Li><Li> Inzi Controls</Li><Li> Hyundai Kefico</Li><Li> Mitsubishi</Li><Li> Gems</Li><Li> Sensata</Li><Li> Weichai</Li><Li> Yuchai</Li><Li> Ampron</Li><Li> Dongfeng</Li><Li> Jucsan</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany ABS Sensor Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany ABS Sensor Market apart.
