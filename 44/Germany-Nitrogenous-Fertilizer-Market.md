Urea, being the most widely used nitrogenous fertilizer, holds a significant share in the market due to its high nitrogen content and cost-effectiveness. It is favored by farmers for its versatility and efficiency in promoting plant growth. Urea is often used in a variety of crops, including cereals, vegetables, and fruits, as it provides essential nutrients for rapid plant development. This widespread usage of urea is a key driver for its dominance in the German market.</p><p>Ammonium nitrate, another major segment, is commonly used for high-yield crops due to its fast-acting nature and ability to enhance soil fertility. It is typically preferred for crops that require immediate nitrogen supplementation. Calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) is also a notable segment, offering a slower release of nitrogen, which helps reduce nitrogen losses through leaching and volatilization. Ammonium sulfate, while a smaller segment, is still significant due to its dual role in providing both nitrogen and sulfur, crucial for crops that require these nutrients for optimal growth.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/575376/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">Germany Nitrogenous Fertilizer Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;Germany Nitrogenous Fertilizer Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Nitrogenous Fertilizer Market size was valued at USD 120 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 160 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 4.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;Germany Nitrogenous Fertilizer Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Agrium</Li><Li> CF Industries</Li><Li> PotashCorp</Li><Li> Yara International</Li><Li> Bunge</Li><Li> Coromandel International</Li><Li> CVR Partners</Li><Li> Eurochem</Li><Li> Hubei Yihua</Li><Li> ICL Fertilizers</Li><Li> Koch Industries</Li><Li> Rentech</Li><Li> Sinofert Holdings</Li><Li> The Mosaic Company</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;Germany Nitrogenous Fertilizer Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the Germany Nitrogenous Fertilizer Market apart.
