The liquid soy sauce segment holds a significant share of the market due to its versatility in culinary applications. It is widely used in various traditional and modern German dishes, such as marinades, soups, and stir-fries, enhancing the flavor profile with its rich umami taste. Additionally, the ease of incorporation and storage of liquid soy sauce makes it a preferred choice for both households and foodservice sectors. The increasing preference for liquid soy sauce, owing to its convenience and ready-to-use nature, continues to drive its growth in the market.</p><p>On the other hand, the paste variant of Fe fortified soy sauce caters to niche consumer preferences, especially among individuals seeking a more concentrated flavor. Paste soy sauce is used in specific recipes requiring a thicker consistency and intense flavor. This segment, although smaller in comparison to the liquid variant, is gaining traction due to its potential to add depth to various Asian-inspired dishes.
