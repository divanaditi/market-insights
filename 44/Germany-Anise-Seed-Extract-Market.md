The liquid extract holds a significant share of the market due to its versatility in various industries, such as food and beverages, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. Liquid anise seed extract is widely used for flavoring and as a natural remedy for digestive issues. Its concentrated form makes it easy to incorporate into a wide range of products, thus driving its demand in the market. Additionally, the liquid form is preferred in the pharmaceutical industry for the preparation of herbal medicines and tonics, further boosting its market presence in Germany.</p><p>On the other hand, powder anise seed extract is also gaining traction due to its ease of storage and longer shelf life.
