Luxury sports cars have a growing demand as more individuals aspire to own a status symbol that provides both thrill and comfort on the road, making it a significant portion of the market share in the country.</p><p>On the other hand, performance sports cars focus more on raw power, agility, and track-ready capabilities. These vehicles are engineered with an emphasis on performance, offering exceptional speed, acceleration, and handling. Performance sports cars cater to enthusiasts and drivers looking for an exhilarating driving experience.
