Cardiovascular surgeries also play a crucial role in the market, driven by the prevalence of heart diseases and increasing awareness of cardiovascular health. Furthermore, neurosurgeries, which deal with brain and spinal conditions, are steadily rising due to the advancement in medical technology and greater access to specialized care. These different surgical categories reflect the growing demand for healthcare services across both countries.</p><p>The segmentation of the Germany-Iraq healthcare market by type also includes specialized surgeries that cater to specific needs in both nations. For instance, cosmetic and reconstructive surgeries are gaining traction in the market, driven by the growing awareness of aesthetic enhancements and the availability of advanced surgical technologies.
